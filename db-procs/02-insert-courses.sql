This course examines how Black women in the US, impacted by the intersection of patriarchal misogyny and anti-Black racism, face both hypervisibility and invisibility. Their experiences with public safety are often ignored, complicating discussions about state-sanctioned violence and their protection. We will explore how narratives around gender and race shape public safety perceptions and policies. Through videos, readings, podcasts, guest speakers, and discussions, this course investigates the role of narrative power and rhetoric in shaping the experiences and advocacy for the safety and freedom of Black women and girls. We''ll analyze how these narratives impact their rights and the broader fight for their well-being and self-determination.'),
('ANTH 21505','Narrative Power in the Black Radical Tradition','For over 250 years, against all odds and in the face of extreme genocidal violence, Black people in the United States have persevered and "have countered vicious dehumanization with determined and successful re-humanization." Central to the struggle for Black liberation is the use of symbolic resources. Such resources include "words, signs, images, music and even bodies [which] shape our perceptions of reality and invite us to act accordingly." From the abolitionist movement to end slavery to the Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th century to today''s Movement for Black Lives, Black organizers, activists, and allies use symbolic resources to resist and inspire a new vision of society. By taking advantage of political opportunities and disrupting hegemonic thinking, Black insurgent social movements expand collective perceptions of what is socially, economically, and politically possible. The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter is a symbolic resource, as was Emmitt Till''s open casket, both exposing that which is often concealed—the ghoulish manifestations of white supremacy. Social movements use these symbolic resources to reveal patterns, cultivate compassion, recruit members, inspire collective action, and build public will for sweeping social changes. In this course, we will explore the role of narrative power and rhetoric in the Black Radical Tradition, what political theorists Cedric Robinson describes as the collection of cultural, intellectual, action-oriented labor aimed at disrupting social, political, economic, and cultural norms originating in anti-colonial and antislavery efforts. This tradition is not only one of resistance against oppressive forces but also of joy, embodiment, and love. Through readings, podcasts, special guests, and discussions, we will explore how Black movement workers have used narrative, story, and other symbolic resources to build narrative power for radical notions of liberation and freedom.'),

And what does it mean to say that a nation is rich or poor? These questions have special importance in Latin America, where people have lived through five hundred years of economic booms and busts. In this class, we ask fundamental questions about Latin American economic life—which turn out to be fundamental questions about economic growth itself. What is GDP? Does economic growth make people happier? Is technology the secret to more growth? Our primary texts are ethnographies – the stories of people who are living through growth – but we also read works of economists and other thinkers.

('ANTH 31131','The Archaeology of Race and Slavery: Memory, Monuments, and Memorialization','What does the recent controversy surrounding monuments to the Civil War tell us about race in the past and present? How is slavery remembered, and how can archaeology contribute to our understandings of the experiences of enslavement and freedom? This course will address these questions and others to investigate the archaeological intersections between race, slavery, freedom, memory-making, and memorialization. Using the removal of Confederate monuments as a point of departure, the course seeks to explore how archaeologists study race and slavery through the material record, treating monuments, memorials, and the material traces of slavery as archaeological artifacts that are informative of broader social attitudes concerning race, memory, and nation building.'),

Students will be introduced to the anthropological and archaeological methods that have been utilized to study these legendary bandits from a perspective different from what’s portrayed on the big screen. Through analysis of archaeological and historical sources, the course explores the seas of the Caribbean, where pirates struck fear into the hearts of mariners, traders, merchants, planters, and colonial authorities for centuries. The simultaneous rise of piracy and capitalism in the region is not coincidental, and we explore the strong, and often contentious, relationship between the two, including how the transatlantic slave trade played a vital role in the rise of piracy. We’ll confront the legends and myths surrounding infamous pirates like Blackbeard, “Black Sam” Bellamy, Captain Morgan, and some lesser known bandits to separate fact from fiction. Despite the popularity of these larger than life figures, we spend far more time discussing the thousands of individuals who comprised the motley crew of Caribbean pirates and unpack how piracy was perceived by throughout the Atlantic world. Archaeological and historical scholarship will touch on multiple facets of the lives of pirates on the high seas from their ships, their everyday belongings, the goods they plundered, the hideaways they called home, the people they forged relationships with, the havoc they caused, and the legends they left behind.'),

('ANTH 31503','HIP HOP & POLITICS','From the political theory of Adolph Reed to the comedy of Bill Cosby we find a critique of the “hip hop generation” so dismissive it might be a useful point of departure for further historical and theoretical inquiry. In realizing the worst fears of a previous generation that has placed its hopes in the aspirations of 60s-era social movements, does this new generation''s fashion sensibilities, technological savvy, and strategies for commodifying blackness suggest a demographic now more concerned with the economics of globalization than the political economy of race? To explore this question, we consider a diverse set of readings, and music, and film clips, to interrogate the generational tensions that structure popular and intellectual discourses concerning the “hip-hop generation” and the perceived demise of black politics. ?'),

('ANTH 31906','Archaeology of Democracy and Despotism','This class will explore the wide range of political systems that existed in the ancient world – from egalitarian and representative formats to highly centralized, and even despotic, ones. We will draw on archaeological and historic case studies from East Asia, the Mediterranean, North America, the Andes, and more to provide us with a long-term view of how political systems develop and dissolve. How did political players encourage cooperation, hierarchy, authority, or inequality, and how were these practices institutionalized? How can we identify these practices in the past?

('ANTH 31955','Anthropology of Masculinities','Instead of studying "masculinity" as singular gendered identity, the class delves into theories of gender, sex, race, ethnicity, religion, and ability to look at masculinities across a wide spectrum of power. The class will look at ethnographic detailing of masculinities and its difference across categories and social contexts. In addition, looking at the relationality and intersectionality of masculinities is crucial to understanding how meanings, social patterns of relations, and hierarchies then emerge from practices of masculinities. These are some guiding questions: What are racialized masculinities? What are the gender politics within masculinity?'),
('ANTH 31956','Politics and Society in the Middle East','This class introduces students to core topics in the study of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA): (post-) colonialism, modernity, nationalism, state formation, economic development, democratization, gender, religion, and the politics of daily life.

('ANTH 31960','Archaeology of Displacement and Migration','Mobility is a deeply material process that affects how humans interact with landscapes, things, socio-political structures, and each other. While migration and displacement are not new phenomena, the current crisis raises urgent questions concerning how we understand the human experience of migration and the social and political processes that weigh on that experience. Using an archaeological framework, this course will analyze migration and displacement from the ancient past to the present through the lens of material culture. Part of this course will also include the installation of the global pop-up art exhibition, Hostile Terrain 94, which materially engages with the ongoing crisis unfolding at the US/Mexico border.'),
('ANTH 31961','Environmental Inequality','This course explores the relationship between humans and their environments, with an emphasis on issues of power and inequality.

A cross-cultural and global consideration of how food is connected to nutrition, environment, the state, and land.'),
('ANTH 31964','DECOLONIZING EDUCATION','Schooling has proved one of the most powerful modern technologies for socializing and enculturating successive generations of students. This course engages with the problems the Anthropology of Education has posed since its formalization in 1950s and 1960s for schooling, learning, and the reproduction of inequality. Utilizing readings, films, and discussions we investigate the “hidden curriculum” schools, the distance between the official goals of educators and actual effects on students and we will ask why education, so often posed as remedy to society’s problems, seems to instead perpetuate failure for many of its students. Exploring decolonizing, structural, informal, and other anthropological approaches, we will examine the rich ethnographies that have challenged assumptions about schooling and provided surprising and insightful nuance to how students learn, resist, and experience education."'),
('ANTH 31965','MUSEUMS & ANTHROPOLOGY','What does it mean to preserve, display, and remember culture? Though museums were foundational institutions for anthropologists to display and interpret culture, in recent decades critical questions of ownership, voice, and decolonization have become forefront for museum studies. Through a series of readings, films and discussions this course will critically engage with anthropological concepts and entanglements with museums in our historical and contemporary world. We will explore issues of diversity and inclusion, colonialism and ownership, and voice and representation. We will critically assess major museum institutions, community museums, experimental museums as well as monuments and ask what it means to represent, negotiate and contest human material and visual culture.'),
('ANTH 31966','Counterinsurgency and the Social Sciences','According to the U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual No. 3-24, published in 2007, “counterinsurgency is not just the thinking man’s warfare—it is the graduate level of war.” Against this background, this course provides historical, cultural, and intellectual perspectives on counterinsurgencies. The focus is less on specific battles than on the following: the historical and geographical contexts of counterinsurgency; how its doctrine and practice have drawn on methods and concepts more traditionally associated with social sciences including anthropology; the ethical and political issues and debates this has raised within the discipline and academia generally; how media representations have worked to gain public approval for counterinsurgency campaigns; and how societies have dealt with their aftermath. Course materials include cultural, political economic, and historical approaches and focus on different eras and areas of the globe.'),
('ANTH 31967','Hip Hop & the Global South','Once a localized activity designed to provide a refuge for Black and Latino youth in places like New York City, Hip-Hop became a global brand that impacted youth''s cultural, political, and economic realities across the world.

The course will take an intersectional approach to all these topics, with a particular focus on intersectionality and Black feminism in week 11. The aim of this course is to think, reflect, and learn about ourselves as socio-historical and cultural beings permeated by linguistic interactions that reinforce and/or resist gender normativity.???'),
('ANTH 31969','Human Variation','Humans vary in many important and interesting ways. Unfortunately, this variation is frequently misunderstood and used to classify, divide, and justify the oppression of minority groups. We will explore the basics of evolutionary biology so we can understand how humans vary biologically and why. We will discuss topics such as sex and gender, skin color, and racism to better understand how evolution impacted our biology and deconstruct harmful stereotypes about sex and race. By doing so, the course will attend to anthropology’s role in scientific racism and the faulty notions of human variation that still need to be dismantled in society at large.'),
('ANTH 31977','Picturing Development','How do images--in photographs, paintings, film, and more--shape the way people think about international development? In this class, we will explore how visual materials both construct knowledge and raise ethical concerns. We will also examine the origins of visual anthropology, depictions of “exotic” peoples and places in publications such as National Geographic, tourist and travel photography, and the use of visual materials by international development NGOs. While primarily devoted to reading and writing about these issues, the course will also include a practical element, including experimenting with the creation of visual materials.'),

In this multidisciplinary course students will learn about the historical trajectory of the "witch" as a source of feminist and feminine political resistance. Moreover, the course''s focus on critical race theory will center witches of color as a way to disrupt the potential white-centric cooptation of the present resurgence of the Bruja.'),
('ANTH 31980','Anthropology of Peacebuilding: Transitional and Social Justice','This course introduces students to an anthropological study of peace and peacebuilding. By looking at the array of ways communities organize to respond peacefully to war, state violence, and socioeconomic marginalization, this course examines how transitional and social justice is sought after by victims of war, social/political activists, and youth community leaders.'),
('ANTH 31981','Environmental Racism','While Environmental Justice as a field encompasses most of the Environmental Racism discussion, the last notion is still in dispute. It is a concept born in the United States and abroad throughout the 1970s and 1980s and coined by Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr. In the context of the United States, Environmental Racism often emphasizes the inequalities between urban and nonurban areas in terms of racialized communities. Internationally, Environmental Racism can refer to the effects of the global waste trade, like the negative health impact due to the export of electronic waste from the wealthiest states to the so-called developing countries, as well as the particular vulnerability of indigenous groups to environmental pollution. Environmental Racism is a term that entitles a fair understanding of environmental injustices within racialized groups. Why have we continued to use Justice instead of Racism? Why keep using climate change if it does not impact people equally? As its ultimate goal, this course endeavors to address this issue using Critical Race Theory in socio-environmental case studies.'),
('ANTH 31982','Humans and Animals: Companions, Monsters, Food and More','Our histories, religions, rituals, ideas of nature, and the very concept of what it means to be human are punctuated at every step by multi-species relationships.

This course will range over a broad scope of these past, present, and future shared interactions with animals including domestication, art, companionship, hunting, sacrifice, myth, ethics, wealth, and more. We will draw on ethnographic literature, archeology, folklore, representative art, and other contemporary and past case studies of human and animal interactions from around the globe to build a rich discussion of the current and future approaches to living with animals.'),
('ANTH 31983','Muslims & Jews in Morocco','There has been a flourishing Jewish presence in Morocco for at least two millennia.

('ARCH 61019','Race, Space, and Architecture in the United States','In 1902, W.E.B. DuBois wrote these telling words in The Souls of Black Folk: “The problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color-line,—the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea (9).” This semester we will take up DuBois’s claim and examine it in relationship to architecture in the United States. The focus will be largely on the twentieth century and buildings, landscapes, and places in cities although we will take some excursions to other places and periods in world history. By dissecting the race in concert with the constructed environment in the U.S. we will expose how Americans have used space to condition understandings of race, to reinforce racial and ethnic hierarchies, to perform identities, which are in flux, and to contest egregious and enduring inequalities. The goal is to understand that there is a dynamic rather than a static relationship between a physical place, its social make-up, and race as an ideal or imagined condition.'),
('ARCH 61020','Digital Constructs','The architectural (re)presentation or the architectural diagram-be it photo real, abstract or analytical, captures the energy of an idea about space and the forces that act within it.

Digital Constructs investigates the concepts, techniques, and working methods of computer aided ''drawing'' and representation in architecture. Students will study the operative relationship between 2d and 3d data, exploring the reaches of their analytical and (re)presentational potential. While the class is a foundational course in architectural computing, it will build on the student''s advanced ability to question, shape, and interrogate space and time.'),
('ARCH 61021','Housing Projects and Urban Challenges in the Americas-A North-South Historical Analysis','The physical production of housing is partially responsible for the development of social dynamics like urban inclusion and mobility, segregation and informality. While developmentalist theories commonly consider the Global North and South as essentially different realities, urban social problems are increasingly global and underline the historical deployment of a planetary form of urbanization. This is especially true in the case of Latin American architecture, epitomized as “exotic” or “underdeveloped” in popular culture, and which historically shares challenges like explosive population growth, suburbanization and urban decay with the Western hemisphere. To open, thus, architectural historical analysis to a global sphere of reflection, this seminar presents an overview of urban problems common to the North and South of the Americas between 1945-2000 – a period of unprecedented internationalization of urban politics, from the creation of the United Nations Charter to the Millenium Declaration. The seminar also explores how architectural housing projects that contain design and planning components have addressed urban challenges, and assesses how the physical solutions given to these problems fit the goals established by these urban programs. Through a comparative analysis of Latin American and North American cases, the seminar seeks to evaluate if urban policy outcomes are successful, vis-à-vis their architectural outputs. The ultimate goal of the course is to understand the role of housing projects as catalyzers of social reform, and to learn the lessons that these projects may bring to an urban and policy context.'),
('ARCH 61022','Modern Landscapes of the 20th Century','The course starts with a review of 20th Century garden precedents; establishing the aesthetic and cultural motivations that informed early expressions of the modern landscape garden, open space and urban development. The coverage then turns to a survey of various styles and theoretical underpinnings that have influenced a wide spectrum of contemporary landscapes and their designers, including the design of specialized urban and suburban open spaces, ecologically determined plant community restorations, corporate headquarters campuses, vest pocket parks, theme gardens and new city forms. The course ends with a discussion on possible future directions for landscape design and the current forces influencing them.'),

This seminar is autonomous from the process of the Independent Study track as part of the Advanced Studio Sequence. Nonetheless, it is meant to aid those students seeking entrance into said program as well of any student seeking to produce advance research in Architecture.'),
('ARCH 61024','Compositions','To understand the ingredients of an artifact like architectural construct is to know the intrinsic behaviors of the materials used and the formations that can be adapted to them. Traditionally, architects envision the use of materials provided to them. In this course, we will experiment with designing a material. Focusing on composites, binders and fibers can be selectively mixed and calibrated to create the material behaviors corresponding to the specifics of a design sensibility. Concrete, resin, bioplastics, silicone, glues along with a range fibrous materials and/fillers would be the subject of material research. The course is consisted of parallel development of advanced computational modeling, material experimentation and fabrication concluding with a group project of a pavilion/large furniture scale construct.'),
('ARCH 61025','Retrofitting Suburbia','In this design research seminar, we will be immersed in the growing discourse on the retrofitting of suburbia.

This is a design research seminar; the ambition is to prepare graphics suitable for publication.'),
('ARCH 61026','Le Corbusier: Architecture, Urbanism, Politics','Whether extolled as the greatest architect of the twentieth century or reviled as the century’s greatest scourge, Le Corbusier, more than five decades after his death, remains a fundamental reference for the disciplines of architecture and urban planning. Over the course a long and preternaturally productive career (some 400 projects, more than 70 built works, about 50 books) Le Corbusier essentially reshaped the way we think and design our buildings and cities. This seminar aims to unravel Le Corbusier’s lifelong project through an in-depth study of his seminal writings and his most significant architectural and urban designs. In exploring modernism’s most emblematic figure, the seminar ultimately aims to reconsider the contested legacy of modernism and its continuing relevance in contemporary architecture and urbanism.'),

At the end of the 18th century, this is exactly what engineers, architects, masons and cartographers were able to do thanks to the techniques of Descriptive Geometry as codified by Gerard Desargues and Gaspard Monge. These drawing techniques allow complex three-dimensional forms to be modeled in two dimensions - yielding an endless number of auxiliary views of an object. After a series of exercises which teach students to master this technique, we will translate these complex 2D drawings into 3D models in Rhino and then output geometrical intersections as physical models using the Milling Machine and 3D printer. Through this exchange between two-dimensional drawing, three-dimensional modeling and physical output, students will expand their understanding of both the history of projection drawing and the geometrical principles which underpin the 3D modeling software we all take for granted today.Basic skills in Rhino, AutoCAD, and Adobe Illustrator are required.'),

('ARCH 61413','Imagining Manhattan: building the island and its discourses, 1811-present','For more than two centuries Manhattan has been both the object of urban thinkers'' fantasies and a laboratory for urban movements and design strategies. Architects and urbanists in the 19th and 20th centuries imagined idealistic and dystopian plans for the great city, with roadways stacked five or ten stories high, aerial avenues of commuter airplanes, or uncontrolled speculative skyscrapers turning the city into a bleak lattice of canyons. But the islands realized dreams were often even more audacious; among the grandest of these was the 1811 legislation of the cities. Cartesian block grid at a moment when most of the island was farmland and forest. But no more timid are a town made from towers (Rockefeller Center), a neighborhood where the Hudson recently flowed (Battery Park City), and an 800-acre populist artificial garden made from the most valuable land in the world (Central Park). This course considers the movements, ideologies, and theoretical frameworks that transformed Manhattan into the island as it continues to rise today. Field visits will supplement in-depth analysis of the city''s architecture and urban designs.  In the course''s hybrid component, students will investigate,collectively and individually, the history of a particular site of their choice, engaging not only with its original design, subsequent modifications, and present state, but also with the unrealized architectural and urban fantasies to which it has played host.'),

('ARCH 61605','Activist Space in New York City','An examination of participatory practices in re-purposed buildings reveals the critical relationship between real estate, architecture and activism. In cities across the country, in the 1970’s, the devaluation of property created a vacuum of ownership. Vacant lots, storefronts, schoolhouses, factories and abandoned tenements in New York City became havens for experimental, communal practices. These same urban landscapes, in the present time, are facing the opposite crisis of inflated costs and speculation by development that threaten the small gains made by communities in historically marginalized neighborhoods. What new practices are emerging in cities such as New York that can sustain these activist spaces and challenge the status quo? What are the new modes of participation that can produce new, radical outcomes? Is there room for socially conscious design and art practices? Expanding the discourse of sustainable practices within the built environment to include grass roots participation is important for the equitable development of cities. Working at the intersection of history, adaptive reuse and collaborative design, this class will interweave theory and practice to find new ways to advocate for equity and social change. Amid current debates about urban justice and access to public space this class will critically re-visit the often-overlooked domain of civic participation- commercial storefronts, offices, gardens, artists collectives and community centers where citizens gather to plan acts of political dissent and collective participation. The class will visit some of these sites and the everyday spaces with a long history of counter-institutional practices will be considered as case studies. For the final project, students will create a “zine” that memorializes the efforts and projects a future for a particular “activist” endeavor.'),

The latest thin- film coatings reduce emission and control the amount of solar radiation transmitted indoors. Other technologies make glass translucent or transparent in seconds or allow to generate energy. However, in most projects the environment of a building is not properly taken into account and it has come short to harmonize material based performance criteria such as visible light transmission, heat gain/loss and ventilation and to connect them to the appearance of the building. Changes are required not just in technology, but also in people''s behavior. Incentives such as Building LEED certifications certainly help but a more significant impact can be achieved through policy changes that require a more energy efficient way of designing a building. During this Semester, the students will learn about innovative glass technologies and internalize this knowledge when analyzing and critically discussing case studies of real buildings. They will learn to use this knowledge to improve the glass façade of an existing buildings (three buildings will be given as choice). The students will be asked to improve the current design while focusing on appearance, interior heat gain, enhance natural light quality for vital space interaction and comfort and maintain regulated air flow. The final results shall be showcased on a Poster (size 24” x 36”). The progress of the project will be enhanced throughout weekly assignments.'),

During this time of upheaval, artists mobilized heterogeneous and oppositional practices such as geometric abstraction, conceptual art, mail art, street interventions, murals, performance, video art, and earth art. Course discussions will focus on the aesthetic strategies artists cultivated to tackle the effects of colonialism, state violence, abrupt modernization, migration, exile, and violent dictatorships in various countries and regions. In discussing the relation of Latin American and Latinx art and artists to European and U.S. cultural centers; the emergence of multi-media art; the role of art criticism on the notion of the popular; and the rise of arts institutions (modern art museums, international biennials and fairs, galleries, cultural exchanges), we will also consider the ways in which postwar art in the Americas reflects and has been codified against a north-south geopolitical order and a Euro-centric and dominant art history. As the global struggle for racial and social justice continues, what can we learn from artists in the global south? What can we learn from a history of art that seeks out the voices of the underrepresented, the marginalized, and the oppressed? And how can artists, critics, educators, historians, and museum professionals engage the crises of the past to inform and transform our present?'),

('ART A6920','A counterfactual is part of a thought experiment that speculates on the possible paths','A counterfactual is part of a thought experiment that speculates on the possible paths events could have taken. We commonly encounter counterfactuals in sweeping historical reimaginings (What if the Third Reich had won the Second World War?), but they can also help us ask critical questions about the forms of reparation and restitution owed to communities for past wrongs. A counterfactual is not an "alternative fact," Kellyanne Conway''s means of distinguishing "fake news" from the Trump administration''s view of reality. Nonetheless, counterfactual thinking may provide some perspective on the disinformation campaigns destabilizing governments and populations worldwide. Counterfactuals surveys this subject over three thematic blocs. The first provides historical context for counterfactual artistic practice by studying fictional and pseudonymous artists, parafictional strategies, and so on. The second focuses on reparations and restitution, with particular consideration given to the United States. The third looks at the spread of disinformation and measures taken, in the United States and beyond, to counter it. These topics are explored through lectures, readings, assignments, and online group activities.'),
('ART A6921','Modernism & Avant Garde India','To mark the republication of Geeta Kapur’s When Was Modernism (2000, 2020), this course unpacks Kapur’s vast contribution to modernist art theory—to questions of art, nationalism, and internationalism; leftism and third world politics; gender and queerness; abstraction and figuration; canonical theories of the avant-garde and neo-avant-garde; and contemporary art’s globalization. Despite the importance of her work, Kapur’s writing can be a challenge for readers unfamiliar with South Asian art history. This course will therefore serve as a chronological survey of South Asian modernism from the colonial period to the contemporary and a study of Kapur’s key articles and texts. This dual approach situates key movements in South Asian modernism within framework that can be mobilized for a comparative and decolonial approach to modernist art history globally and throughout Asia, as we will see in selected comparative readings and images in class.'),
('ART A6922','Decolonizing the Digital','This course offers a critical new perspective for the study of computer, electronic, digital, and internet art. Since the late 1990s, theorists of digital culture working with frameworks from critical race theory and postcolonial studies, such as María Fernández, Lisa Nakamura, and Alondra Nelson, have decentered whiteness and Eurocentrism, both of which had historically overdetermined this area of study. Building on that work, this course incorporates decolonial theory and Indigenous studies, demonstrating that coloniality and Native dispossession have structured digital culture as much as race and Western imperialism. Ideas such as discovery, invention, and technological expertise have largely excluded Native peoples from histories of computation and digitally mediated art. Furthermore, the material consequences of computer manufacture—contingent on Indigenous dispossession, as well as exploitative labor practices that disproportionately impact Black, Brown, and Native people—are often overlooked. This course therefore considers a range of visual material culture from the ancient to the contemporary, expanding the timeline for the study of digital art while also reimagining digital epistemologies and histories. It centers on the hemispheric Americas given the relationship between coloniality and modernity (Aníbal Quijano), maintaining that the continuing effects of colonial systems legitimate displacement and extractivism.'),

Research projects for this course will involve work with primary sources in CCNY and NYC institutional collections.'),
('ART A8156','Photography and the Book','The course surveys the photographic medium from its inception to the present by tracing the history of the photographic book. The earliest photographers embraced the book medium, the development of both fine art photography and scientific illustration are linked to photographic books, and today, virtually all printed books are made by means of digital photographic technology. Within the history of photography photobook studies are an increasingly active research area. In an age of increasingly digital image production, photographic books are newly historical artifacts requiring contextualization and analysis. We will consider: the book as an object; image-text relationships; how photographic books relate to the art market and the museum; photographic books and activism; the challenges of incorporating early photographic prints into printed volumes; the relationship of hand-made and mass-produced books; and the development of the photobook genre in the 20th century and its evolution in the 21st centuries.'),
('ART A8157','Decolonizing the Digtial','Digital media seems to permeate every aspect of daily life, even those moments “offline” or away from screens. They have been said to have a specific epistemology, reformatting relations, aggregating data, and compositing content. However, what exactly is the “digital” in digital media? What, if anything, makes it distinct from other forms of media? To consider these questions, this course will cover a broad range of media histories. Most begin in 19th century Europe following the effects of the Industrial Revolution. Early “computers,” optical devices, photography, film and cinema, and then digital computers are often teleologically construed, bringing us into our digitally networked reality. This hegemonic history of media is considered alongside alternative genealogies and historiographies. A particular emphasis is placed on technologies and innovations developed by QTPOC cultural producers across the Americas, from whom and where knowledge, resources, and labor were—and are—extracted to invent so-called “new media.” Media archaeology will be employed as a method, leading to discussions of “old” media and their impacts, such as the Inka khipu as an early computer, or the plantocracy of the Americas as the originary panopticon (Jeremy Bentham’s prison design theorized by Michel Foucault as a metaphor for disciplinary society, used in the present to describe a surveillance state). However, most of the artistic and cultural case studies in the course will be contemporary (post-1945), introducing students to visual production that pushes forward queer* and decolonial understandings of what constitutes “technology,” “media,” and the “digital.”'),

This course will look at repertoire of tropes and practices that Afro-Latinx artists have employed to visualize Black identity and address the historical subjugation of people of color. Among the questions we will pursue during the semester are: how have constructions of Blackness changed and evolved over time in the Americas; what can we learn from past struggles to advance “Black power” via art and culture; what kinds of artistic projects on behalf of social justice are effective today? Our course begins with a comparative study of the New Negro/Negritude/ Negrismo movements in the 1920 through the 1940s. In Section II of the course, we will look at work by Afro-Latinx artists involved in solidarity movements to liberate nations in Africa and Latin American with a focus art of the Cuban Revolution. Section III will feature an overview of art and activism during Black Power Movement in the United States. We will also take a deep dive into the history of Afro-Latinx artist-run spaces and collectives in New York, California, Chicago, and Texas during the 1970s and 1980s. Our final classes will examine the global impact of the art of Jean Michel Basquiat, survey works created by Afro-Latinx artists for the Columbus Quincentenary in the 1990s, and feature talks with contemporary Afro-Latinx artists involved in groups such as Black Lives Matter, Decolonize this Place, and The Supper Club.'),

From theories such as movements such as mestizaje and indigenismo to afrocubanismo, artists and intellectuals in Latin America were preoccupied with constructions of racial identity as they sought both to account for indigeneity, racial hybridity, and the African diaspora in the push toward cultural and political nationalisms. Disenfranchised politically, racialized subjects featured prominently in the formation of modern, state and aesthetic policies by the intellectual elite, raising questions of cultural appropriation and primitivism, at the same time that they reveal anxieties over the construct of whiteness. Breaking with centuries of Euro-centrism resulting from colonialism, however, many of these vanguard movements and cultural thinkers attempted to engage with local racial thematics precisely to assert their modernity. Engaging with a variety of manifestos, painting practices, and socio-historical contexts, we will concentrate on aesthetic formations of race in the broader effort to put pressure on a (white) Euro-American art history.'),

('ART B7111','Coalitions and Counter-Institutions: American Art in the 1970s','This seminar explores the history of art in the 1970s by looking at the various activist coalitions, alternative spaces, loft theaters, magazines, and other artist-run organizations that emerged across the United States, in cities including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Amid the decade’s political and economic crises, artists founded these platforms in order to enable collaboration, confront a lack of representation in museums and commercial galleries, and connect their individual practices to broader social objectives, including women’s liberation, Black nationalism, the Chicano movement, and post-Stonewall LGBTQ activism. Through case studies of specific organizations and the artists associated with them, we will ask how the decade’s principal aesthetic strategies—site specificity, institutional critique, body art, performance, object theater, video, conceptual photography, and craft—became rooted in both local struggles and national politics. Case studies will include 112 Greene Street, A.I.R., Africobra, the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition, the Floating Museum, Hallwalls, Heresies, Just Above Midtown, the Plaster Foundation, and Womanhouse. In parallel with weekly readings and seminar discussions, students will spend the semester preparing a research paper on a relevant topic of their choosing.'),
('ART B7112','International Avant-Garde Networks','This seminar will examine the historical avant-garde and neo-avant-garde movements of the twentieth century in an international context. We will begin by considering how the historical avant-garde emerged both as a reaction against the militarized nationalism of World War I and as a response to new forms of collective identification rooted in leftist politics, feminist discourse, anti-colonial struggle, and mass migration. Particular attention will be paid to how the avant-garde rejected traditional artistic mediums and engaged instead with performance, film, photography, and other media. We will then trace how international networks of artists formed through communication technologies, the transfer of institutional models (e.g. the Bauhaus), and the travels of influential figures (e.g. Marcel Duchamp, John Cage). Finally, we will turn to the neo-avant-garde movements of the post-World War II era, taking a comparative approach that will consider how various avant-garde strategies and concepts—such as happenings, assemblage, mail art, Pop, and Fluxus—were deployed to address specific local circumstances in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. In parallel with weekly readings and seminar discussions, students will spend the semester preparing a research paper on a relevant topic of their choosing.'),

Questions and topics will pertain to discussions of diaspora, dislocation, cultural aesthetics, and hybridity, among others. Readings include critical and theoretical texts, as well as exhibition catalogs and artists'' statements, revealing a plethora of approaches and ideas by artists, art historians, critics, curators, and other aestheticians.'),
('ART B8020','International Pop Art','Andy Warhol''s soup cans and Roy Lichtenstein''s comic strip art are well known as quintessential Pop art, the wildly popular movement that is identified with the 1960''s in the U.S. less well known is the fact that Pop art was an international art movement, as demonstrated by the exhibition "International Pop" at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in spring 2016. This course, like the exhibition, traces the migration of the style from the UK to the US to western and eastern Europe, Latin America, and Japan. It will focus on the distinct forms of the style in each region as well as the shard interest in mass media, consumerism and figuration.'),
('ART B8021','Postcolonial Art and Exhibitions','This course will familiarize you with postcolonial art and theory through a global history of exhibitions from 1989 to the present. The "postcolonial" is imbricated with a host of important discourses and concepts: agency, alterity, ecofeminism, hybridity, dislocation, multiple modernities, neo-colonialism, orientalism, and globalization (to name only a few). In order to gain a firm grasp of these ideas, each week we will engage a formative exhibition dealing with postcolonial issues ( beginning with Jean-Hubert Martin''s "Magiciens de la terre" at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris from 1989, one of the first displays to critique Western ethnocentrism in art). This exhibition history is inherently global and we will, broadly speaking, travel from Latin America to Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Accompanying these weekly exhibition case studies will be readings in postcolonial theory by influential thinkers, including Homi Bhabha, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Edward Said, Okwui Enwezor, Franz Fanon, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, among others. Each student will work on a seminar paper researching an exhibition of their choosing, which they will present to the class at the end of the semester.'),
('ART B8022','Photography Inventions','When, where, why, how and by whom was photography invented? What was early photography like and how did it look? What were its shortcomings, and how was it a marvel of technology? What was the world like before photography? What can we learn from the history of photography’s inventions? We know that photography has changed the world (again and again and again) but this course will also explore some of the developments that have changed photography. How do artists, and other users of photography respond to the specific properties of the medium as it is successively re-invented? This course concentrates on the multiple inventions of photography. Working separately in different countries, several individuals sought to invent automatic imaging systems using photo-chemistry and the principles of optics in the 1820s and 1830s. Great minds thought alike, and several different types of photography were born almost simultaneously. We will discuss what scientific/artistic invention is and means--how it happens, as well as exploring the evolution of the photographic medium. We will spend time considering each of the main 19th photographic processes and the remarkable images created in each, as well as the emerging photographic image culture to which each invention contributed. Later in the semester, we will continue to explore how inventions and transformations in technologies shape photographic expressions. The invention of small hand-held cameras using roll film (which made possible amateur photography and so brought photography into everyone''s daily lives--as well as making possible the practice of photojournalism), of flash and strobe photography (which allow the capture of motion and the exploration of nocturnal subjects), of color photography and eventually of digital imaging, have all transformed the medium of photography further. Do these successive transformations take photography in new directions, or do they return it to its origins? By studying the history of photography from the perspective of inventions, technologies and transformations, we will gain an overview of the medium.'),

In seminar style, we relate readings to a selection of artworks from Europe, Asia and the Islamic world to think about how early modern visual arts structured erotically charged vectors of looking and being looked at that confirmed, hyperbolized, instrumentalized and even made magic of gender norms. We look at gender play and the regulation of gender in and through the visual arts. The subject of gender before the advent of gender studies offers means to think outside of familiar frames of analysis, and the goal of taking a global perspective is to critique methods that developed primarily in relation to European art. A basic proposition will be that the visual arts have historically been gendered. The hope is to imagine new interpretive horizons. Undergraduates will be admitted with permission of the instructor.'),

Historical precedents, such as Joseph Beuys’s performances and the films of Chris Marker, will form the backdrop to the course''s main focus on more recent forms of advanced art, such as bio-art, ecological art, and inter-species collaborations. Emphasis will be placed on tracing the profound ways animals have come to be reconfigured in art, online culture, and climate politics. To further their own thinking and practice in relation to these themes, students will also gain critical proficiency through essential readings across a number of different fields, including animal ethics, bio-politics, cognitive ethology, ecofeminism, environmental studies, postcolonial studies, and posthumanist theory.'),
('ART B8702','Art of Jerusalem: Power & Piety in the Holy Land','This course will explore the art and architecture of Jerusalem from the reign of Herod through the Crusades, a period in which the city came under successive Jewish, Roman, Byzantine, Islamic, and Latin domination. Particular attention will be given to the repeated transformation of the landscape of Jerusalem through the destruction, construction, and modification of important religious and cultural monuments. We will gauge the role of Jerusalem as an object of desire for the dispossessed and for pilgrims of three faiths. In addition, we will explore how the accretion of myth and memory shaped the city’s symbolic identity, and how this imaginary ideal, as expressed in art and architecture, emphasized or denied the physical and political realities of medieval Jerusalem.'),

The first part of the course explores the early influx of African objects to Europe beginning in the 19th century; displays of African arts and culture at Colonial Expositions and other colonial-era venues; issues of commodification and classification; and the construction and presentation of African objects in private settings, art museums, and ethnographic collections. The second part of the course surveys recent curatorial strategies—particularly as related to permanent collections, theme-based exhibitions, and biennials—as well as issues of “authenticity,” provenance, quality, repatriation, and value'),
('ART B8706','Mexican Muralism: Revolution, Public Art, and The Burdens of Representation','Muralism in Mexico has provided a model of socially-engaged aesthetic practice ever since artists first put brushes to government walls in the 1920s in the aftermath of the first social revolution of the twentieth century. This seminar explores the contested meanings, tensions, and shifting legacies of creating radical art in the public sphere, while it also seeks to analyze the movement’s claims for racial justice. Lectures focus on the divergent working practices in Mexico of los tres grandes (Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros) and the circulation of their work in the United States, Latin America, and Europe. Students have the opportunity to broaden the narrative of muralism with investigations of lesser-known artists as well as the movement’s impact on other regions of the Americas, including connections between Mexico City and Harlem and the solidarity networks forged between the so-called Mexican and “Black art” Renaissances.'),
('ART B8707','Modern Africa: Art & Decolonization','Designed broadly for students of postcolonialism and global modernisms, this course explores 20th-century African arts in relation to the highly varied contexts of colonialism, decolonization, the Cold War, and capitalist imperialism. Modern African expressive forms developed as early as the 1920s and ’30s in colonial schools and among scattered independent practitioners. Following World War II, a next generation of art critics and image-makers gained visibility under the predominating yet controversial influence of the Paris-based Negritude movement. By the 1960s and ’70s, modernism flourished in some parts of the continent with support from new national governments. Many states additionally sought to modernize indigenous traditions. And a growing chorus of skeptics began sounding alarms about authoritarianism, corruption, and foreign intervention. Because classificatory orders in Africa were never so commanding as they tend to be in the West, modern art and visual culture will be examined in this course through a cross-genre and multi-media lens: one that registers how “high” and “popular” cultural elements have often merged or become blurred; and one that looks at drawing, painting, and sculpture alongside performance, photography, and film. Course readings privilege primary texts. We will additionally read scholarship in African art history, anthropology, and postcolonial studies, among other fields.'),
('ART B8708','Art & Climate Change','Today''s unprecedented level of human-caused climate change has given rise to a worldwide call for action towards a sustainable ecological future. Contemporary artists have responded by creating artworks that raise awareness of the environmental impact of individual and industrial activity, demonstrating how art can contribute to climate change communication and to reframing our relationship with the more-than-human world. Artists also foreground the disproportionate impact of climate disasters on historically marginalized or underserved communities. Through readings, discussion and looking at images, the course will provide an opportunity to approach these important and timely developments in visual art.'),
('ART B8709','Participatory and Socially Engaged Art','This course examines the history and theory of participatory and socially engaged artistic practices. These practices involve the direct interaction and participation of various publics, notably through video, performance, installation, and community art projects. We will consider antecedents across the twentieth century, from the historic avant-gardes to the proliferation and formalization of such practices in the 1990s. Along the way we will study the philosophers and theorists who have driven this participatory turn of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, including texts by Claire Bishop, Nicolas Bourriaud, Guy Debord, Édouard Glissant, Jean-Luc Nancy, and Jacques Rancière, alongside artists writings. In addition, we will consider the current state of participatory art and explore how it can—or perhaps cannot—meet our most urgent challenges: racism and the continuing legacies of colonialism; social media and its impacts on democratic politics and public spheres; the pandemic’s profound altering of our conceptions of community; and the looming threat of climate disaster on public space and our ability to live on this planet. This course is global in scope and we will be working with artists, collectives, and activists from all over the world.'),
('ART B8710','Modernism, Colonialism, Internationalism','This course situates modernist painting within a global context. We will begin by considering how the major artistic tendencies of the first half of the twentieth century, among them cubism, abstraction, concretism, realism, and surrealism, developed amid the circulation of peoples, objects, and concepts under colonialism. Then, we will trace how these tendencies developed differently in Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia, and the United States, connecting the work of individual painters to the larger themes of the postwar era: the aftermaths of Auschwitz and Hiroshima; the decolonization of the global south; the formation of international institutions; the spread of commercial culture; and the ideological divisions of the Cold War.'),
('ART B8711','Gender and Sexuality in Mughal Arts','Early critical theory in art history addressed questions of gender and sexuality to the European tradition, and that shaped how the discipline, even today, conceptualizes the male gaze and the formative role of images in the formation of sexual subjectivities. This class turns to the visual arts of South Asia during the Mughal period (1556-1858) to consider a different regime of gender, sexuality and the image. What does it mean to theorize gender and sexuality outside European traditions? We revisit canonic readings on these topics, as well as examples of critical thinking about gender and sexuality from other areas of art history. We consider how historians of Mughal art have begun to find a way forward to deal with Mughal works of art that put sexuality front and center of political and social discourse, and together we consider possible avenues for the future.'),
('ART B8712','Art in the Age of Black Power','Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, Black Power grew into an expansive and heterogeneous set of ideologies that cohered around the struggle for Black political, economic, and cultural self-determination and the creation of Black community infrastructure and mutual support. Focusing on art produced within the climate of Black Power, this course examines the range of strategies taken up by Black artists during these decades alongside debates around “Black Art” and what it meant to be a Black artist at the time. It will consider activism that agitated for the display of Black artist’s work and the hire of Black curatorial staff at established institutions, the creation of Black-run collectives, museums, and galleries, as well as the production and circulation of art outside institutional spaces in the streets and in print. Special attention will be paid to work and activism by Black women artists, as well as to the movement’s international dimensions and its intersections with contemporary liberation struggles in the United States, such as the Chicano Movement.'),
('ART B8725','Modern Art in the Global Cold War','Allthough the field of global art history has been largely concerned with contemporary art and with developments in the international art world under globalization (i.e., roughly since 1989), its temporal frame has expanded over the last decade or so. The field now includes exhibition projects, edited volumes, and specialized monographs that chart some of the international and transnational circuits of modern art since the end of World War II. Some of this work responds to an extensive literature on modern art and the Cold War whose main hubs have conventionally been Paris and New York. This course will engage with and build upon some of this recent curatorial and scholarly to explore other hubs and axes of modern art during the age of decolonization and the early Cold War period. We will look especially at trajectories of American, French, and African and diaspora modernist production between Africa, Europe, and North America.'),
('ART B8726','Love, Metaphor and Vision in Early Modern India','This is a class about what love imagery made possible for South Asia’s multiethnic, religiously diverse society during Mughal imperial rule (1556-1858). The pervasive theme of love in Mughal fine arts suspended cultural differences in poetics, intellectual play, and mysticism to result in a distinctive aesthetics that emphasized emotional affect. We follow the theme of love as it circulated through the closely interrelated mediums of painting, textiles, poetry and music. Gender and sexuality are be front and center of our discussions, along with self-fashioning and the bonds fostered through connoisseurship. Class discussions and assignments encourage students to ask new questions and to explore untried methods, especially with a view to globalizing the discipline.'),

('ART B9001','Art of Comics: 1800 until today','Comics (comic strips, comic books, comix, and graphic novels) are a vital part of modern visual culture and yet they are rarely studied by art historians. From Rodolphe Töpffer''s "picture-stories" to superhero comic books and beyond to graphic novels, we will examine the formal development of the medium and its relationships to art history and visual culture. We will analyze the shifting position of the comic book in American popular culture, while also emphasizing the stylistic and narrative development of the form. We will pay attention to the ways in which artists establish flow between panels, structure pages, arrange text and image, and facilitate transitions. We will consider points of intersection between comics and the art historical canon with particular emphasis on pop art, new figuration and contemporary art.'),

('ART B9902','CDMX: Modern Visual Culture of Mexico City','This seminar explores the visual cultures of Mexico City, one of the cultural capitals of Latin America, across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. From Muralism to the street interventions of Los Grupos, and from Surrealist exiles to international artists who make the city their base today, CDMX has been the nexus for a wide array of artistic networks, approaches, and movements. The material, aesthetic, and social-cultural remains of the histories of colonization and slavery as well as the living presence of Indigenous communities, creoles (criollos), Afro-Mexicans, and mestizos (people of mixed descent) make Mexico City a unique, critical locus for such artistic imaginaries. In the twentieth century, the capital transformed from a modest and essentially agrarian locale, attracting (primarily Indigenous) workers from across the nation, into a contemporary megalopolis (the third largest city in the world). From paintings and photographs in the early and mid-century that directly figured the city’s marginalized, racialized bodies and colonias within broader efforts to define race and nation in Mexico, to contemporary spatial practices that are rooted in the formal logic of Mexico City’s margins, artists have drawn upon and enacted urban sites to reveal the city’s racial and social tensions and inequities. Covering a wide range of material, including performance, architecture, graphics, photography, public sculpture, murals, film, popular/mass art, and urbanism, this seminar asks how has this city inspired and impacted artistic practices? How are urbanism, the built environment, and the unique textures and resonances of the metropolitan area reflected in modern and contemporary artistic production? This discussion-based seminar encourages students to think through the open-ended potential of art to shape global cities and their futures. In the early weeks of the semester, students will present on and discuss readings. Students are encouraged, in consultation with the instructor, to take on interdisciplinary approaches to their research paper topics and to explore connections to other cities and cultural capitals, by framing their analyses in global and transregional contexts, with Mexico at their center. Papers engaging Latinx and Chicanx communities in the United States are especially welcomed. Projects will be presented in class followed by group discussions.'),

('ART 31124','Contemporary U.S. Latin@Art','This course serves as an introduction to art made by artists of Latin American descent born or raised in the United States. We begin with a survey of artists who immigrated from Latin America and the Caribbean to make their careers in New York City in the late 1960s. This includes artists such as ADAL, Luis Camnitzer, Agustin Fernandez, Rafael Ferrer, Rolando Peña, the New York Graphic Workshop, Marisol, Catalina Parra, Liliana Porter, Fanny Sanin, and Ana Mendieta. Following this generation of early immigrants, students will be introduced to artists of Latin American and Caribbean descent born in United States or who immigrated in their youth, including Juan Sánchez, Raphael Montanez Ortiz, Maria , and Sophie Rivera. The course also takes stock of some of the earliest exhibitions that featured U.S. based Latino artists as well as newer exhibitions that focus on younger generations, including selections of Latin@ artists from biennials presented at El Museo del Barrio. Two units on West Coast and Southwest-based artists from the 1970s through the present explore the work of artists such as John Valadez, Gronk, Patssi Valdez, Ester Hernandez, and the collaborative avat-garde Chicano group ASCO. A unit on posters and graphics by Chicano and Puerto Rican artists from the 1970s illustrates the affinities between these groups working on opposite sides of the country. Finally, the course ends with a selection of contemporary artists who represent the diversity of the art scene in New York City including a selection of Latin@ artists who are represented by top galleries and featuring informal artist talks by Dominican (York) artists and a younger generation of Puerto Rican artists.'),

('ART 31127','Postcolonial Art and Exhibitions','This course will familiarize you with postcolonial art and theory through a global history of exhibitions from 1989 to the present. The “postcolonial” is imbricated with a host of important discourses and concepts: agency, alterity, ecofeminism, hybridity, dislocation, multiple modernities, neo-colonialism, orientalism, and globalization (to name only a few). In order to gain a firm grasp of these ideas, each week we will engage a formative exhibition dealing with postcolonial issues (beginning with Jean-Hubert Martin’s “Magiciens de la terre” at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris from 1989, one of the first displays to critique Western ethnocentrism in art). This exhibition history is inherently global and we will, broadly speaking, travel from Latin America to Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Accompanying these weekly exhibition case studies will be readings in postcolonial theory by influential thinkers, including Homi Bhabha, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Edward Said, Okwui Enwezor, and Franz Fanon.'),
('ART 31128','Photography Inventions','When, where, why, how and by whom was photography invented? What was early photography like and how did it look? What were its shortcomings, and how was it a marvel of technology? What was the world like before photography? What can we learn from the history of photography’s inventions? We know that photography has changed the world (again and again and again) but this course will also explore some of the developments that have changed photography. How do artists, and other users of photography respond to the specific properties of the medium as it is successively re-invented? This course concentrates on the multiple inventions of photography. Working separately in different countries, several individuals sought to invent automatic imaging systems using photo-chemistry and the principles of optics in the 1820s and 1830s. Great minds thought alike, and several different types of photography were born almost simultaneously. We will discuss what scientific/artistic invention is and means--how it happens, as well as exploring the evolution of the photographic medium. We will spend time considering each of the main 19th photographic processes and the remarkable images created in each, as well as the emerging photographic image culture to which each invention contributed. Later in the semester, we will continue to explore how inventions and transformations in technologies shape photographic expressions. The invention of small hand-held cameras using roll film (which made possible amateur photography and so brought photography into everyone''s daily lives--as well as making possible the practice of photojournalism), of flash and strobe photography (which allow the capture of motion and the exploration of nocturnal subjects), of color photography and eventually of digital imaging, have all transformed the medium of photography further. Do these successive transformations take photography in new directions, or do they return it to its origins? By studying the history of photography from the perspective of inventions, technologies and transformations, we will gain an overview of the medium.'),

('ART 31162','Gender, Desire and the Gaze in Early Modern Visual Arts','The course takes a global perspective on gender and sexuality in early modern visual arts. In seminar style, we relate readings to a selection of artworks from Europe, Asia and the Islamic world to think about how early modern visual arts structured erotically charged vectors of looking and being looked at that confirmed, hyperbolized, instrumentalized and even made magic of gender norms. We look at gender play and the regulation of gender in and through the visual arts. The subject of gender before the advent of gender studies offers means to think outside of familiar frames of analysis, and the goal of taking a global perspective is to critique methods that developed primarily in relation to European art. A basic proposition will be that the visual arts have historically been gendered. The hope is to imagine new interpretive horizons.'),

('ART 31923','Avant-Garde Art in Post-war South Korea in a Global Context','The course examines post-WWII art and visual culture in South Korea and other localities, and investigates why Western notions and forms of the avant-garde held such importance. The complex relationship between art and politics will be explored by examining various manifestations of political and social critique by South Korean artists and intellectuals in art and visual culture, as well as, by artists in other parts of the world. South Korea during the post war years, was primarily led by the military-oriented, authoritarian governments that operated under a Cold War ideology after the Korean War (1950--1953) ended in 1953 until 1993. During this period, while the country’s economic development was on a lightspeed fast track with its American alliance and superficial democratic political system, the negative effects of the economic boom was the severe restriction of human rights and political dissent. Communist witch hunts were prevalent in South Korea as they were in the United States during the McCarthy era. The course will map out the genealogy of the avant-garde in the West, its global circulation, and finally its South Korean renditions. After the midterm exam, the class will focus on several South Korean art collectives which engaged in avant-garde forms of art, music, performance, and literature to advance their cultural and political critique against the military regimes and analyze the various artistic strategies and tactics used by these dissidents to promote democratic reforms. A group of young South Korean artists were banded together in art collectives to mask their dissidence and resistance behind re-contextualized notions of Western avant-garde art. In addition to addressing various topics related to the South Korean and global avant-gardes, this course will also consider postcolonial theories pertaining to South Korea and non-Western cultures, and the histories and theories of protest and activism in art, as well as, a comparative critique of the various global avant-garde arts'),

('ART 31943','Afro-Latinx Art and Activism in the 20th and 21st Centuries','Over the last century, Afro-diasporic artists in the Americas have continually affirmed the value of their African and Indigenous heritages as sources of inspiration and signs of resistance to the oppressive legacies of colonialism and racism. This course will look at repertoire of tropes and practices that Afro-Latinx artists have employed to visualize Black identity and address the historical subjugation of people of color.

('ART 31945','Gender and Sexuality in Mughal Arts','Early critical theory in art history addressed questions of gender and sexuality to the European tradition, and that shaped how the discipline, even today, conceptualizes the male gaze and the formative role of images in the formation of sexual subjectivities. This class turns to the visual arts of South Asia during the Mughal period (1556-1858) to consider a different regime of gender, sexuality and the image. What does it mean to theorize gender and sexuality outside European traditions? We revisit canonic readings on these topics, as well as examples of critical thinking about gender and sexuality from other areas of art history. We consider how historians of Mughal art have begun to find a way forward to deal with Mughal works of art that put sexuality front and center of political and social discourse, and together we consider possible avenues for the future.'),

('BLST 21009','Black Women''s Resistance: Narratives of Safety and Survival','In the 20th and 21st centuries, the safety and survival of Black women have become central to rethinking public safety. The #SayHerName campaign exemplifies this shift, offering a platform for voices often marginalized by mainstream media. This course examines how Black women in the US, impacted by the intersection of patriarchal misogyny and anti-Black racism, face both hypervisibility and invisibility. Their experiences with public safety are often ignored, complicating discussions about state-sanctioned violence and their protection. We will explore how narratives around gender and race shape public safety perceptions and policies. Through videos, readings, podcasts, guest speakers, and discussions, this course investigates the role of narrative power and rhetoric in shaping the experiences and advocacy for the safety and freedom of Black women and girls. We''ll analyze how these narratives impact their rights and the broader fight for their well-being and self-determination.'),

('BLST 21505','Narrative Power in the Black Radical Tradition','For over 250 years, against all odds and in the face of extreme genocidal violence, Black people in the United States have persevered and "have countered vicious dehumanization with determined and successful re-humanization." Central to the struggle for Black liberation is the use of symbolic resources. Such resources include "words, signs, images, music and even bodies [which] shape our perceptions of reality and invite us to act accordingly." From the abolitionist movement to end slavery to the Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th century to today''s Movement for Black Lives, Black organizers, activists, and allies use symbolic resources to resist and inspire a new vision of society. By taking advantage of political opportunities and disrupting hegemonic thinking, Black insurgent social movements expand collective perceptions of what is socially, economically, and politically possible. The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter is a symbolic resource, as was Emmitt Till''s open casket, both exposing that which is often concealed—the ghoulish manifestations of white supremacy. Social movements use these symbolic resources to reveal patterns, cultivate compassion, recruit members, inspire collective action, and build public will for sweeping social changes. In this course, we will explore the role of narrative power and rhetoric in the Black Radical Tradition, what political theorists Cedric Robinson describes as the collection of cultural, intellectual, action-oriented labor aimed at disrupting social, political, economic, and cultural norms originating in anti-colonial and antislavery efforts. This tradition is not only one of resistance against oppressive forces but also of joy, embodiment, and love. Through readings, podcasts, special guests, and discussions, we will explore how Black movement workers have used narrative, story, and other symbolic resources to build narrative power for radical notions of liberation and freedom.'),
('BLST 21510','Art & Protest','This course offers the opportunity to reflect upon the relationship between art and activism by applying, in students'' own creative work, critical tools and methods generated by contemporary theory and social history. While art is often perceived as unrelated to and independent of politics and social history, this course will examine how these underlying contexts affect aesthetics. Many artists have resisted traditional and conventional approaches to art in order to inform us of the existence of other perspectives, histories and voices. Through creative projects and the exposure to other artists'' works, readings and films, this course will explore the realities within which images are made. Some of many questions for contemplation and discussion include: What is taste and how is it acquired? Who is responsible for the writing of our history? What is the relationship between money and art history? To what extent do artists simply parrot traditional values in their work? What outlets are available for activist artists? Have alternative aesthetics and radical activities challenged the writing of mainstream representation? How can artists define a political/activist position, and what responsibility do they bear in making images?'),
('BLST 23800','Political Systems of Africa','This course provides a broad overview of African politics. It does so in two ways.

('BLST 27006','Gentrification & the Cultural Identity of Harlem','This course explores contemporary Harlem, which is at a crossroads. After three centuries and five decades of continuous development, Harlem is poised for a rebirth. But unlike the cultural-artistic movement of the 1920s, this renaissance is political, class and economic driven. As brownstones and buildings that once stood empty for decades are rehabilitated and vacant land is redeveloped, and new homeownership opportunities are created through public and private partnerships, Harlem’s longtime residents and small businesses are in jeopardy of being displaced and the cultural identity of Harlem potentially lost. In their examination of gentrification, students will consider its effect on the Harlem community, their own lives and their families. Students will apply critical thinking and explore how to preserve the social, cultural and architectural history of Harlem. Students will position themselves as community activists with the purpose of creating public policy and resources that will help achieve affordable housing and sustainable equitable economic and community development for both longtime residents, businesses, and newcomers. Students will have the option to choose from several topical themes to explore and build a civic engagement digital project.'),
('BLST 28200','Modern and Contemporary Latin America','This course will introduce students to several major narratives of modern and contemporary Latin American and Caribbean history from the late eighteenth century through the late twentieth century.

Students are encouraged to bring in further perspectives, and other aspects of knowledge.'),

From the 15th century to the contemporary period, we will look at the religious experiences of Africans and Afro-descendants in the Atlantic world (West and West-Central Africa, Europe, and the Americas). We will consider how the historical legacy of racism, slavery, patriarchy, colonialism, and imperialism, as well as Black agency, resistance, and ingenuity, has set the contours for defining and characterizing Black religions across time, space, and geographies. The course offers explorations of distinct traditions such as Orisha-Ifa (Yoruba), Vodun (Fon) or Vodou, Palo (Bakongo), Obeah, Hoodoo, Afro-Catholicism, Afro-Protestantism, Islam, and Espiritismo to inform us of the centrality of Black worship and religiosity in the study of Black Atlantic social, cultural, political, and intellectual history and contemporary life.'),

The course is built around three main parts, including colonial, postcolonial and contemporary Africa.  For colonial Africa, the course examines the French direct rule vs. the British indirect rule and their implications on structures of local societies. Discussion of otherness, race and politics of representation also helps deconstruct the colonial rule. Concerning postcolonial Africa, the focus is on independence movements and main figures of Pan Africanism. In addition, we''ll establish parallels between African independence movements and the 1960s civil rights movements in the USA. As for contemporary Africa, the course critically analyzes relationships between Africa and the diaspora with emphasis on Harlem Renaissance movement and African intellectuals in the 1920s, the return to the source and immigration. Finally, what are the perspectives of political Independence and economic development for a continent that boasts vast human and natural resources.'),

This course is a survey of the major film movements and cycles during the 1970s. While the course will address Blaxploitation films, the class will as well importantly consider how not every black film during this 1970s period belongs to the Blaxploitation cycle. Thus, the class also focuses on the work of the revolutionary art cinema produced by students based at UCLA (the LA Rebellion), New York based-black independent films, documentaries, and experimental genre work (e.g., horror, science fiction).'),

('BLST 31156','Entrepreneurship: Women & Dive','This course provides building blocks to entrepreneurship. We begin the class with an overall historical context for women and people of diverse backgrounds as entrepreneurs to recognize ethnic, racial, religious and socio-economic diversity of entrepreneurs. The definition of who is an entrepreneur is evolving and determining what skills will be needed to make an impact in the coming years is relevant.  In the past entrepreneurs were seen as lone visionaries; today, teams, divisions and large enterprises are striving to be more entrepreneurial. Connecting theory with practice, we infuse entrepreneurship throughout this curricular while asking how gender difference impacts the experiences of women entrepreneurs versus their male counterparts.  Women are starting businesses at a faster rate than the population at large and this course will explore an emergence of a whole new social and economic order, which can accurately be labeled a female economy—in every country and every arena—this is a significant upheaval. The data gathered is clear and startling. Women have tremendous spending and buying power worldwide—and it’s growing. Market estimates about women’s total purchasing prowess vary, upwards of $18  trillion as of 2017. Therefore, there is reason to believe, that more women will become entrepreneurs and investors in the years ahead.This course will explore how women behaviors related to savings and investing. Out this outset, this helps the students to better understand how women can position themselves to create more businesses, jobs and stimulate the economy.  The course is to provide participants with the tools, strategies, and confidence needed in order to assess, determine feasibility of, and launch and grow new businesses or reinvigorate existing businesses. This is the place where education and imagination meet, spurring the creation of innovative companies.  Discussions will include raising capital, developing a viable business model and product, strategies to grow a company, leadership skills, startup successes and failures will be studied to glean lessons learned and innovation.'),
('BLST 31157','Blackness and the Arts','The class provides an introduction to the aesthetics and cultural history of blackness and the arts.

('BLST 31158','African Cities: Pop Culture and Politics','The African city is a vibrant space of creativity and pluralism that brings together people from different backgrounds, which is evident in the various artistic expressions such as music, film, graffiti and fashion. The city-space can also be a site of tensions where opposing forces or entities have to coexist by negotiating their work and living spaces. In addition, as a place for the realization of the individual, the city is a space of dreams and adversity. So, the city is not only a space of creative vibrancy but also of hustling which highlights resourcefulness in the face of everyday struggles. The study of the African metropolis will critically look at contemporary African cultures and everyday life beyond the exotic images of timeless rural Africa which are often relayed by the media. Reading selections include texts from theorists such as Achille Mbembe, Mamadou Diouf, Frederic Le Marcis and Walter Benjamin.

('BLST 31188','Performing Black Womanhood in the United States','African American women’s identity is a highly contested social, cultural, and political (not to mention immensely personal) cite. Throughout the twentieth century, black and white men and white women generated the dominant images of black women in literature, theater, film, music, and the media. Casting them as Mammy, Peola, Jezebel, Welfare Queens, Quota Queens, and Nappy-headed Hos, cultural producers, politicians, and spin doctors have dismissed, hyper-sexualized, de-sexualized, objectified, and demonized black women. Yet, simultaneously, black women have defined themselves and fought bitterly to claim control of their bodies, representation, and rights as citizens of the United States. These efforts have both challenged and reinforced the dominant narratives, as for every stereotype that is dismantled, a new one seems to grow back, hydra-like in its place. Performing Black Womanhood explores the social, cultural, and political ramifications of identity formation and representation and the ways in which twentieth-century black women performed (both on and off the stage and screen) aspects of their identity and attempted, with varying levels of success, to control their images and influence political agendas.

This course is designed to be an in-depth analysis of the legendary bandits, mischievous scalawags, and barbarous buccaneers that roved the high seas from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. Students will be introduced to the anthropological and archaeological methods that have been utilized to study these legendary bandits from a perspective different from what’s portrayed on the big screen. Through analysis of archaeological and historical sources, the course explores the seas of the Caribbean, where pirates struck fear into the hearts of mariners, traders, merchants, planters, and colonial authorities for centuries. The simultaneous rise of piracy and capitalism in the region is not coincidental, and we explore the strong, and often contentious, relationship between the two, including how the transatlantic slave trade played a vital role in the rise of piracy. We’ll confront the legends and myths surrounding infamous pirates like Blackbeard, “Black Sam” Bellamy, Captain Morgan, and some lesser known bandits to separate fact from fiction. Despite the popularity of these larger than life figures, we spend far more time discussing the thousands of individuals who comprised the motley crew of Caribbean pirates and unpack how piracy was perceived by throughout the Atlantic world. Archaeological and historical scholarship will touch on multiple facets of the lives of pirates on the high seas from their ships, their everyday belongings, the goods they plundered, the hideaways they called home, the people they forged relationships with, the havoc they caused, and the legends they left behind.'),

('BME G2500','Biomedical Device Infections','Implant infections have emerged as a compelling cause of failure associated with tissue-contacting biomedical devices. All such devices are susceptible to infection. Among them are hip and knee prostheses, heart valves, pacemakers, cochlear implants, shunts, surgical mesh, sutures, as well as next-generation tissue-engineering constructs, among many others. Implant infections occur when microbes colonize a device surface and develop into a biofilm. Because biofilms are highly resistant to antibiotics, implant infections are extremely difficult to eliminate. They are often resolved only by removing the device, eliminating the remaining tissue-based infection, and then re-implanting a new device as part of one or more subsequent revision surgeries. The consequences can be significant. In the case of a prosthetic joint infection, for example, the revision process can take many months and many tens of thousands of dollars, and the complications can spiral into compromised life styles and, in some cases, death. The CDC estimates that the annual cost of healthcare-acquired infections - the great majority of which involve some form of tissue-contacting device - is approximately $30-$40B in the United States alone. Solving implant infections requires a convergent interdisciplinary state-of-the-art approaches from Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry and multiple fields of Engineering, This course is intended for students who want to learn about problems associated with medical-device-associated infection and identify an impactful set of steps which can be pursued to create a trajectory that increasingly pushes its rate of occurrence towards zero over the coming decade and beyond.

How was it that the Athenian democracy was also an aggressively expansionist empire, and that citizens of the egalitarian democracy regularly owned slaves? How did Athenian men justify the exclusion of women from politics? What did women do with their time instead? Athens’ rival Sparta was a very different state; what important values did the Athenians and the Spartans share?

We will work towards producing a complete draft of a new prose piece a short story, novel excerpt, or hybrid fictional piece. In-class and take-home writing exercises will spark new pathways to generate and polish creative work. Our focus will be on process, building a rigorous, fertile space in which new writing can flourish, developing constructive writing habits that bolster our productivity, and supporting the development of other writers. While students may execute pre-existing ideas, our intention will be to write entirely new work. Writers will receive feedback on their fiction during in-class workshops and individual conferences with the instructor. We will foreground discussions of exemplary works by established writers including Junot Diaz, Paule Marshall, Edward P. Jones, Edwidge Danticat and ZZ Packer. We will also watch films and talk about exploring the writer''s life, for example, The Price of the Ticket, The Agronomist, and A Litany for Survival.'),

('ENGL B1980','Hybrid Forms: Poetry and Nonfiction','Maybe you have pieces that you want to fuse, or you write in a variety of genres and styles and can’t settle on one. This generative workshop/craft class explores hybrid poetics and nonfiction. We will discuss how writers use poetry and nonfiction (memoir, lyric essay, creative nonfiction) in innovative ways—blending them with interviews, conversations, translations, philosophy, history, other forms of literary art. Students will create new work in a variety of hybrid forms. Border works cross divides by crossing genres, forming a genre of their own. Students diversify their creative practices, and leave the course with hybrid works and a deeper understanding of the ways in which hybridity broadens their voice.'),

Patience, in this context, is the difficult and demanding work of revision. Students will hone their critical skills through close readings of poems and the drafts that made those poems possible, and in prose responses to reading assignments. Texts from which readings will be assigned include Black Lightning: Poetry-in-Progress and Making Poems: Forty Poems with Commentary by the Poets.'),

Exploring autobiographical writings as well as works of fiction, we will address the complexities of acculturation, the pervasiveness of estrangement, and ambivalence toward Jewishness. We will pay attention not only to content but also to form, examining how, for many of these writers, innovation was a key aspect of self-expression. In addition to the readings, students will undertake writing exercises and assignments, and will be asked to submit their work for class discussion. The course is open to advanced writing students of all backgrounds who wish to deepen their understanding of themselves in relation to the world.'),
('ENGL B1986','Craft of YA Fiction, Writing for Teens: from Idea to Publication','This practical course guides students through the craft of writing a young adult novel, while incorporating real-world insight into paths to publication. Students will engage in active craft techniques for idea, character and plot development. They will learn to use their own life experience, memories, identity exploration and cultural background to create a more authentic narrative that feels fresh and original. Through the course of 15 weeks, students will develop their own idea into a novel-length story concept, and then into the first chapters of a partial manuscript. In the process, they will gain a deeper understanding of working with critique groups, the young adult publishing landscape, the business of publishing a novel, query letters, book contracts, and the relationship between authors, agents and editors. This course includes a mix of lectures, real-time writing sessions, group feedback and dedicated time for student question and answer.'),
('ENGL B1987','From Idea to Publication: A Deep Dive into Genre Fiction','This intensive course guides students through the craft of writing commercial and upmarket genre fiction, while incorporating real-world insight into paths to publication. Students will engage in active craft techniques for idea, character and plot development. They will learn to use their own life experience, memories, identity exploration and cultural background to create a more authentic narrative that feels fresh and original. Through the course of 15 weeks, students will develop their own idea into a novel-length story concept, and then into the first chapters of a manuscript. Students will gain an understanding of the upmarket and commercial genres marketplace including mystery, suspense, thriller, romance, science fiction, fantasy, and women?s fiction, and their many subgenres. Over the course, students will work with critique partners, gain insight into the current publishing landscape, break down the literary agent query process and the relationship between authors, agents and editors.'),
('ENGL B1988','From Stanza, to Body, to Country: Crafting Place in Poetry','The poet David St. John observed, “Place in writing often exists at that intersection between the reality of place and one''s imagination about that place – what one believes, hopes, or imagines about the various possibilities of oneself in that place.” How does place, in other words, reveal more than the physical setting itself, and the writer’s interiority and obsessions? In this craft class, we will consider the ways in which writing about place enables intimate conversations with the self, communities (both personal and public), and history. Each week, we will read poems and supplementary texts that foreground our discussions of place in a variety of contexts, such as food, architecture, nature writing, myth, and labor, to name a few.'),

('ENGL B1993','Writing From Journals: Fiction and Memoir','English B1993 Writing from Journals, Fiction and Memoir, examines the work of major American, European and Hispanic authors whose writing, letters, and journals embody the dilemmas that they struggle with in their lives. I hope to explore the tension between the journals and the short fiction of Franz Kafka in the early 20th century and Henry David Thoreau in the mid 19th. The latter dramatizes in books that on the surface are about travel, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers or The Maine Wood, but reflect deeper traumas that his journals expose. Similarly, the journals of Robert Musil through the mid 20th century illuminate his difficult fiction as Joyce Carol Oates’ novels and stories construct with an elusive discretion like Kafka and Musil the violence or the cruel paradoxes of love. How do Cynthia Ozick, and Donald Barthelme’s fairy tales, tease their authors, their lives? The professor believes that the language of a writer’s work speaks to his or her secrets. Among the writers we will read will be Bruno Schulz , Witold Gombrowicz, Frederick Douglas, Norman Mailer, Miguel de Unamuno, Jorge Luis Borges, and Italo Calvino. The class will be asked not just to read but to write fiction, journal and memoir in the course of the semester.'),

The unprecedented, meritocratic mobilizations for the World Wars and Vietnam effected dramatic social transformations in masculinity, the role of women, gender relations, sexual behavior, and the status of ethnic Americans and African-Americans. This course explores the representation of these mobilization-inspired transformations in modernist and post-modern literature, a brand new project in literary study.'),

('ENGL B2027','World War I American Literature','Unlike the canonized European literature of World War I, the canonized American literature of this war was written entirely by men who were not combat soldiers. While this course looks at a few examples of that familiar literature (by Hemingway, Faulkner, and John Dos Passos), it focuses on the forgotten literature of World War I, much of which was written by combat soldiers and some of which was written by women; most of these texts were either popular or acclaimed in their own era. In this way, this course attempts to give an accurate sense of the American literary response to and depiction of the world''s first large-scale mechanized war. And much of this literature, though reacting to and focused on the physical and psychological horrors of modern combat, was also reacting to and depicting the huge social shake-up involved in the American army''s unprecedented if partial experiment in meritocracy, as the military mobilized, supervised, and assigned millions of men from all walks of American life to various positions and ranks. At least temporarily, the mobilization redefined masculinity, altered gender roles, and altered the status of men from minority groups and the working and lower classes, as well as women.'),

('ENGL B2031','Langston Hughes Archives 1','This writing workshop and critical-practice course draws from the Langston Hughes Festival Archive at City College to explore the role of writers as preservers of history and culture, as archive creators and curators, as archival subjects themselves. What unique forms can an archive take beyond a physical collection of artifacts? How might the archive inform the creation--and definition--of literary work? What does the archivist/writer choose to include and omit, reveal and conceal? Students will generate creative work, with opportunities to engage the local community. This course is part of the Harlem Archives Project, an initiative of City College’s MFA Program in Creative Writing and Black Studies Program that “enables the next generation of writers to attend to the stories of the Harlem community at large”.'),

As a class, we will read creative works and theory moving us from the colonial period into the present and allowing us to visit locations throughout the Caribbean.'),

('ENGL B2127','Evolution of the Black Narrative Tradition: Nature and Cultivation','This class will focus on the impact of nature or the natural world on African American narratives from Frederick Douglass through to James Baldwin and beyond. We will attempt to locate elements within Black narratives that tie such works one to the other. Ultimately, beyond attempting to use close readings to detect how each text speaks to another, we will also observe such touchstones as Black music, religion, and especially issues of assimilation. Take note, Professor Thompson is a structuralist who works to uncover the inner structure of narratives in order to expose the aesthetic coherency of each text. We may spend much more time, hence, performing close readings of short excerpts of each text in order to see how a single part may help to explicate the whole. This class will not shy away from taboo subjects of sexuality and sticky issues of inter- and intra-racial matters, not only in the text itself, but with references to related to issues in the so-called “real” world.'),

There are select seats for new students interested in beginning to write or conceive a memoir. The cohort of students in this class are dedicated to revising, expanding, workshopping, and editing book-length manuscripts over the course of an entire academic year. Memoir is about you and your story and yet your reader is coming to the page not for you, but because they expect to learn or understand something about themselves or about the world through your story. This class will help you see your own role in a bigger and more universal human story?no matter what your story might be. Writing about your own life can feel overwhelming. There?s simply too much material?how do you know what to leave out? And yet at the same time our stories can feel too small, too ordinary. How do we elevate our writing beyond the personal? In this workshop we?ll focus on shaping the material of lived experience into story. We?ll explore the building blocks of narrative prose: scene, structure, reflection, voice and setting. We?ll workshop your entire manuscript. And we?ll discuss problems and opportunities unique to personal writing: fostering vulnerability; tackling difficult subject matter; incorporating research; avoiding narcissism and solipsism; writing about real people. Our primary texts will be your work. We?ll read each other closely and ask useful, generative questions. We?ll also look at some brief excerpts from great essays and memoirs. And we?ll make time for in-class exercises to help you explore new approaches. My goal is for each student to continue the work of writing, buoyed by a supportive community.'),

('ENGL B6402','Title:Writing with an Attitude: Navigating/Negotiating Voices with Critical Experimental Writing','Academic writing often prescribes stringent parameters of tenor and voice according to its traditions, its disciplines, and its genres. Student writers must often understand these “rules” intuitively because instructors teach them taught tacitly. As a result, our usage and teaching of language delves into privilege, politics, and "politeness." Yet, increasingly, the intellectual labor and the means by which authors express their ideas take on alternative forms through the integration of multiple genres, the textures of language, and the usage of multimodal technology. Contemporary meaning-making then relies upon a variety of semiotic systems and capabilities that writers must learn, practice, and apply. In this course, we investigate and analyze these conventions, yet also explore how contemporary writers push the boundaries of their intellectual work and creative expression: how they integrate multiple talents and sensibilities into the act of composing for particular audiences and rhetorical situations.'),
('ENGL B6403','ABC..NOT as Simple as Do Re Mi: Investigating the Complexities of (Multi)Literacies','In this course, we will investigate the historical conceptions of literacy as well as the ever-changing meanings of "literacies."  As a means to understand these literate "habitudes," we will examine (and practice) the types of communicating capabilities that make life in the 21st century communicative and habitable.  We will reflect about our own literacy abilities and what they do for us and then consider the types of literacies that our educational institutions, our workplaces, and our own personal pleasures value so that we can make informed decisions about how to promote literacy acquisition in our classrooms.  For the literacy teacher, this course will prepare you to broaden the new horizons of the next generation of composers; for the 21st-century writer, this course will offer you a moment of scholarly pause about your own conceptions, strategies, and "habitudes" of writing.'),

('ENGL B6407','Memoir & Research as Writing''s Motivation','In this course, you will explore writing projects that begin with the first-person "I" as a point of departure for creative and capaciously researched composing projects that, ultimately, exceed the first-person perspective.

(For authors who do this type of writing, think of Claudia Rankine, Cherrie Moraga, Carmen Kynard, Allison Bechdel, or Alisse Waterston.) By using combined methods of self-exploratory writing, primary/secondary source research, and analytic introspection, students will produce writing projects that inter-navigate hybrid forms of creative and academic writing.'),
('ENGL B6408','Visual Rhetoric: If You See Something, Write Something','In the 21st century with the advent of varying technologies and a proliferation of social media, meaning-making and meaning-deciphering demand a deliberate and artful interweaving of visual habits, rhetorical strategies, and subjective positionings within the act of interlocution (FleckensteinVision, Rhetoric). Said in a different way, one must concurrently exercise visual knowledge, textual know-how, and audience sensitivity to understand meaning and to convey one’s ideas successfully in a world where the alphabetic and the optic converge to make things happen. In this course, students will recall how the ideas of John Berger, Walter Ong, and Marshal McLuhan forecasted our current relationships between literacy, visual culture, and technology. We will explore how current artists, such as Wan-gechi Mutu, Patrisse Cullors, and Nao Bustamente, use their craft to explore the interrelationships between knowledge and the means of conveying messages; equally, we will investigate how certain academic opportunities have emerged that offer new possibilities for intellectual production (i.e., digital dissertations, online journals). We will read writ-ers/artists who have confronted the challenges of visual culture and have risked genre-bending (For example: Claudia Rankine; Lynda Barry; Maia Kobabe). We will divine how these burgeoning contexts might change the classroom and education more broadly (think Cathy Davidson). Most importantly for the participants in this course, these inquiries will demand that we challenge our own creative abilities to compose with divergent sets of practices, media, and in-sights. Participants will do both low-stakes and high-stakes pieces of experimental critical composing that merge the visual, digital, aural, and performative (. . . maybe also the gustatory, olfactory, and haptic.)'),
('ENGL B6409','Life Writing in Crisis: Memoir as Presence','In this course, we will pause and craft into words our recollections of how we thrived during this period and how writing might act as a means to process what we have experienced and learned. Normally, we accumulate memories over long periods of time—the drips and draughts of life moments fade . . . or, sometimes, remain indelible in our minds. Those memories help us learn how to cope in the world; they help form our identities; they, sometime, remind us of our resilience. “Survivance,” a portmanteau of survival/endurance or survival/resistance, will compel us in this course to compose our sense of resilience over the past two years, to put into words how we have kept our composure (or maybe not).'),
('ENGL B6410','Subversive Literacies: Analyzing QueerThings and Contexts','Have you ever considered how the abilities to read, write, listen, speak, research, and critique the word shape the world in which you live? In Subversive Literacies, we will focus upon how literacy has continually played a role in the dynamic power play between normative literacy sponsors and the marginalized voices that both yielded to them but also resisted them. Many marginalized people’s reading and writing have been systemically restricted by institutionally imposed (and often unspoken) regulations: Jim Crow laws, English-only statutes, bathroom legislation, immigration policies, and educational gag orders have all over-determined how people read, write, think, research, and critically identify and express themselves. As a means to conserve and reproduce their own ideologies, potent literacy sponsors have often disenfranchised people’s literacy capabilities rendering their reading, writing, and researching capabilities less powerful. Yet there is another subversive side of that literate narrative and discourse: marginalized groups use their literacies to resist. Colonial subjects have used literacy aptitudes to resist occupation. African-Americans have used it to countervail racist oppression. Queers have used it to confront and upend homophobia and heteronormativity. Students have used it to challenge inequitable educational positions and policies. Literacy can be weaponized, but it can also be disarmed. This course will challenge you to identify and analyze literate primary objects and within them locate your own literate marginalization (or privileges or both); your memories, family lore, and life-long collected memorabilia will provide the inspiration and evidence for your investigations. Alongside your literacy introspections, we will also learn about the histories, theories, and ideologies concerning literacy and that knowledge will help you position your own story in the larger litanies of literacy.'),

After we conclude our general survey, we will deepen our focus on multimodality and the influence it''s having on the field of composition studies. What impact, if any, have web-based changes in communication practices had on the fields mission and self-perception. What impact has the cultures current preference for designed visual texts that often include image, video, and sound had on pedagogy. We will also focus on the relatively new pedagogy of teaching-for-transfer, which aims to help students transfer rhetorical knowledge from one domain (such as a composition class) to another disciplinary domain (such as biology, art, physics or chemistry). These theories aim to place students within authentic rhetorical situations, to increase their awareness of how to make rhetorical choices based on the demands of audience and genre, and to articulate their understanding of key terms in composition studies so that they are equipped to apply what they learn to writing for their college courses and to their literacy practices at home, at work, and in their communities. Students will be asked to evaluate these pedagogical approaches based on their own experiences as readers, writers, college students, writing center tutors, and instructors. We will pay special attention to both the pedagogical theories and their feasibility. Given our particular contexts and frameworks (including students, faculty, administrators, and infrastructures), how might we use these theories to develop our own reading, writing, tutoring, and teaching practices in diverse courses and educational programs.

Laboring under the need to reflect Euro-American ideals of perfection and innovation, they must also speak to and for a set of African American cultural traditions. In part these concerns reflect problems of audience. A third burden of black poets, as with all artists, is the deeply personal need to illustrate powerful feelings through poetry, to make passions rational, or to communicate an intense love of life. Examining the synthesis or lack thereof of these aims shall be the focus of class discussions. And since the need to appease two different audiences and the poet’s own desires has produced a body of poetic expression that is curiously hybrid in its construction and effect, concepts associated with the notion of double consciousness will complement these discussions, supplying us with a tool by which to explore the hybridicity such texts evince.'),

What’s not as famous or evident is its gay culture. In fact, the Caribbean has garnered a reputation of hostility towards queer lives. Time Magazine even once labeled Jamaica as the most homophobic place on earth. With this idea in mind, what does it mean to be gay and living in the Caribbean? The course uses this question as a call to engage with queer authors within the region or of Caribbean heritage. How do they articulate not just the politics of queer activism but also the reality of queer existence within that geographical space? What local traditions are already embodied as “queer”?

This course is designed to accommodate students at all levels of study. As a basic reading and text analysis class we will begin our critical analysis from an Aristotelian approach to critical approaches inclusive of Cultural Theory, Feminist Theory, Performance Theory and Critical Race Theory. This is a reading and discussion class. We will certainly examine how the roles of women have changed in the past fifty years, as well as racial and gender issues as they relate to love, family, oppression, history and economics. In the process, hoping that students will gain a higher level of critical and analytical consciousness, and a more empowering voice. By the process of close reading we will analyze texts from the social, historical, cultural, political and psychological perspectives.  Throughout the process of this course, we attend to a broader analysis of the relationship between African American Theatre and the broader American Theatre.'),

As we make our way through the semester, we will also have the opportunity to meet with and learn from contemporary creatives who are making art at the intersection of their Black and Jewish identities.'),

In this course, we''ll explore the marginalized narratives buried in classic Jewish texts, including the stories of Lilith, David and Jonathan, Beruriah, Rachel (wife of Akiva), and Kalonymus ben Kalonymus. We''ll dive into the many questions these stories raise, including: How were these characters responded to by their contemporaries? How has Judaism been impacted by marginalizing these stories? With such a dearth of source material, how can we claim or create an authentic female or queer Judaism?'),

Fear not: this summer, we will take a different approach to get familiar with the culture and the literary works that shaped it. From magical kingdoms guarded by dragons, to 19th-century heartbroken romantics, to WWII exiles struggling with inter-generational trauma: we will sample the various offerings of Russian-language writers through fairy tails (skazka), short stories (povest’), and novellas (rasskaz). Our discussions will focus on both the internal organization and meaning of individual stories and the historical evolution of Russian prose and its changing political and cultural contexts. Among the writers we will read are: Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Anna Engelhardt, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Lyudmila Ulitskaya, and many others.

Ideally, the course would be interdisciplinary, incorporating texts from the medical, philosophical, and literary disciplines, and spanning a variety of cultural and linguistic contexts.

At the end of each week, students will engage in a translation workshop exercise, during which they will attempt to produce their own—well informed—English versions of the selected passages from the Russian .classics.

But much of the period’s great literature and art was produced in the bustling, cosmopolitan cities to the south and east. This course will expand the view to take in the greater Mediterranean, from the mystics of Andalusia to the party crashers of Baghdad. We will read poetry and prose in translations from Arabic, Spanish, Greek, and Italian; stories of love and adventure, crime and prayer. We’ll also look at examples of art and material culture of the time. Two required papers, one 2-3 pages, one 7-10 pages, and short responses along the way.'),
('ENGL 35402','Selected Topics in Medieval and Early Modern Lit.: Baroque and Neo-Baroque','Baroque poets including Shakespeare favored the rich, the strange, even the bizarre. Early Modern Poet John Donne compared a young girl to a gory beheading, love to a fleabite, God to a rapist, a hermaphrodite to an inside-out glove. "The most heterogeneous objects are yoked by violence together," complained an early critic. This course begins with Early Modern shocks and outrages (Donne, Milton, Crashaw, Anne Bradstreet, Amelia Lanyer, Margaret Cavendish). We then proceed to new American radical neo-baroque interventions: the Flarf school of (chiefly women''s) poetry; neo-metaphysicals (Edward Hirsch''s "Still Life: An Argument" and Djuna Barnes’s great novel, Nightwood); classics of neo-baroque such as Marianne Moore, Severo Sarduy, and John Ashbery.

In Europe, it was also the time of a scientific revolution, an age when our modern understanding of nature was born. Europeans were encountering the populations of continents whose existence they were not even aware of; they were looking at the skies through telescopes, and at objects close at hand through microscopes. What they saw and what they did change how they understood the world, and also, how they understood themselves. We will be exploring this fascinating moment in history through literary texts and other forms of writing.'),

It will move away from suppositions on the factuality behind myths and legends and instead focus on what effect fictitious literature may have on the real world. We will look at this effect in its medieval context and beyond; in how narrative effects the presentation of the medieval in our own contemporary moment, and how narrative is utilized to promote specific ideas. Our readings will move from the first mention of Arthur by name, through his introduction into pseudo-histories, the changes introduced by the romantic continuations, and into galvanization of the tradition by writers such as Malory, Tennyson, and White. Additionally, we will utilize medieval historical writings which are informed by, or reveal an interest in, Arthuriana to analyze the legends impact outside of fiction and foster interdisciplinary practices. ?'),

('ENGL 35408','Love in the Time of Dragons','This course will seek to familiarize students with the tremendous impact of the concept of love during and following the Middle Ages. It will begin with a look into C.S. Lewis’ argument in The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition (1936) that the focus on love popularized in the courtly romances of the 11th and 12th centuries was a more impactful ideological shift in human thought than that of the Renaissance. Once the course has built an understanding of love within this context, it will look at some of the most famous examples of the tradition across the medieval world: the potion induced affair of Tristan and Isolde; the Persian romance of Vis and Ramin; and the tortuously split desires of Lancelot as he struggles between his love for Arthur and Guinevere; and the sometimes satisfying, sometimes horrifying relationships of Marie de France. The class will compare the differences and similarities of these relationships as well as contrast them to famous relationships which precede the period (Penelope and Odysseus, Pyramus and Thisbe) and succeed it (Romeo and Juliet) to consider what elements of love captivate and endure, and what impact the medieval texts have had on our own culture. It will look at the relatable and the absurd aspects of love both within historical and contemporary contexts. The course will also look at the plight of the lovers, their emotional torture, and the necessary isolation of a courtly romance which has become even more relevant in a world where many have and are experiencing isolations of their own.'),
('ENGL 35409','Medieval Modernity','The consensus of the Early Modern Era seemed to be that closing the door on those dank and dark Middle Ages was for the betterment of humanity, art, culture, and intellectualism. Despite this, medieval stories and ideologies have continued to be a popular mode of expression, an abundant wellspring from which people pull adaptions and continuations which remain relevant well into the contemporary moment. In all media and mediums, the medieval lurks; from popular video games such as The Witcher and Dark Souls series; to international T.V. phenomena like House of the Dragon and Kingdom; to the silver screen in adaptions like The Green Knight; to the countless literary productions which reinvent, recycle, reinterpret, and readapt medieval narratives, characters, and themes found in comic books like Once & Future and novels such as The Buried Giant. This class will explore medieval texts through the lens of relevance, building a foundation of knowledge through readings of medieval material before moving onto later and more contemporary literature to explore why we just can’t seem to shut the book on the Middle Ages.'),
('ENGL 35410','The Medieval Other: Monsters, Witches, and Those People Over There','Medieval literature often plays on the tension between the self and the other, creating an emotional or moral dichotomy between what it represents as “normal” versus that which it deems strange. The figure of the other is familiar to us in its multiple guises as the enemies or evil doers which still lurk in the shadowy pages of our own literature. This class will explore the deployment of the other in medieval literature and history, examining the impetus behind representing the different as dangerous. We will peek into the monster’s lair to see him seeking comfort from his mom, ask the villagers why the witch is outcast when she seems to be the only one providing medicine, and find out why everyone thinks the people across the ocean have one giant foot which doubles as an umbrella. Through our reading we will follow the tradition of representing non-privileged and outside groups (e.g., BIPOC, women, LGBTQIA, neurodivergent, and disabled peoples) as something beyond “normal” in medieval literature and decipher how this has impacted our views of the past as well as our contemporary culture.'),
('ENGL 35411','Sexuality, Festivity, and Animality in the English Renaissance','This course surveys early modern texts to ask what roles sex and sexuality and celebrations and festivities play in constructing the concept of the animal (human and non-human)? This course will explore the strategies that early modern texts (poems and plays, religious and scientific tracts, works of political philosophy and household management) used to represent, categorize, know, and speak of and for animals (human and non-human). Scholarly essays, articles, book chapters, and the occasional book will invite us to consider how the early modern texts continue to live within works of history, theory, literary criticism, and popular culture. More particularly, we will investigate how critical writings form objects of study, such as sex and sexuality or ritual celebrations and festivities, through their engagement with the early modern texts we are reading'),
('ENGL 35412','The Vulgar Middle Ages','Over the course of the Middle Ages language and literature, like almost every other area of medieval culture, existed within a strict Hierarchy. In the Western hemisphere Latin – and eventually French – dominated the “serious” modes of textual production and served as the languages of History, Law, Politics, and Religion. This course will focus on the opposite end of the spectrum, exploring the vulgar or common tongues and texts which spoke to and for the people, and which operated as expressions of comedy and commentary on the world around them. We will discuss the importance and effect of writing in relatively accessible languages during and beyond the Middle Ages (e.g., Shakespeare’s low brow writing and modern creoles, code switching, and digital languages). All non-English texts will be available in translation and our medieval texts will focus on works which contribute to the creation and popularization of Vulgar languages. For example, Dante’s De vulgari eloquentia for Italian; Cantar de mio Cid for Spanish; and Chaucer’s assorted works for English.'),
('ENGL 35413','The Politics of Gender in Early Modern Drama','This class will explore how dramatists such as Shakespeare Webster, Middleton and Dekker, Ford, and Cary represent gender, its anxieties and fantasies, and its performance in early modern culture. The course will examine the ways in which gender was constructed and challenged during this transformative period in English literature. We will investigate the intersectionality of gender with other identity factors, such as race, class, and religion, and its impact on characterizations and themes. Additionally, we will examine gender theory and constructions of gender identity and agency and how these shape our own world and structure our thought. How can these plays help us understand modern gender politics that are their legacies?'),
('ENGL 35422','The Global Middle Ages and Its Outcomes','The Middle Ages, as a conceptualized period, is often forced to fight battles of misinformation on two fronts. The first, that it was a time of significant insulation between cultures which (if they interacted at all) were mainly throwing as many swords at each other as possible or were otherwise comprised of a bunch of white people waiting around for the Enlightenment. The second, that the period has had a negligible impact on contemporary cultures and is something that should be swept under the nearest rug available. Our course will interrogate these views of the Middle Ages through the literature it produced, and the literature, film, and music which is produced about it. We will attempt to construct a more nuanced view of the medieval period. One which, while including a fair share of sword throwing, also acknowledges cross cultural interactions which were decidedly less sharp. We will also examine how the medieval informs the modern in negative and positive ways so that we can recognize why some people are still throwing swords, and why so many books have something to do with a dragon.'),

('ENGL 35603','Revolutionary Poetics','The 19th and 20th centuries were marked by widespread social and political unrest. Yet during this period, a revolution of the mind also took place. Marx envisions the end of class struggle through the awakening of consciousness, and Freud proposes that understanding unconscious thought can unlock inner desires. Both theorists share a radical awareness of oppression and a drive to expose hidden powers?our own and those which challenge us. In this course, we will try to link the revolutions of modernity (sociopolitical, technological, and intellectual) with the transformations happening simultaneously within the world of poetry (formal, linguistic, and conceptual): the democratization of poetic language; the break from traditional literary conventions; the mixing of genres and blending of different speech types. We will consider how poetic reflection might be turned into practical action, and if there?s a relationship between emerging genres of ?free verse? and the prose poem and the growth of the industrial working class. We will also explore the ways art succeeds or fails in shaping the tenets of revolutionary thinking.'),

How could this new world be represented meaningfully in language? What new accounts of personhood, sexuality, ethnicity, ecology, and art would it require? Over the course of the semester, we will unfold a conversation between Victorian writers around these questions, and we will consider what kinds of dialogues we might have with them, what unanswered questions from the nineteenth century we can return to in our own moment of globalization and crisis.'),

('ENGL 36401','Selected Topics in Amer. Lit.: War and Post-War in 20th Cent.

This course explores the representation of these mobilization-inspired transformations in modernist and postmodern literature, a brand new project in literary study.'),
('ENGL 36402','Selected Topics in American Literature: Power and Horror of Performance','In this course, we will explore how American writers depict actors, singers, con artists, demagogues, and ordinary people trying to present their preferred images of themselves in different contexts. We will examine fiction, poetry, and film, paying special attention to what such depictions of performers accomplish in these texts. In some, they may undermine the supposed stability of gender, class, and racial identities or unmask the brutality of market economies.'),

('ENGL 36404','Measuring American Poetry','Traditionally used to describe the meter in which a given poem is written, the concept of measure is one that American poets have problematized with special intensity. One such poet is William Carlos Williams, who in 1948 suggested that measure is the place where poetry “comes into contact with reality.” If it is true that thinking about measure leads to thinking about poetry’s contact with reality, then it is necessary to ask an additional question: namely, can poetry affect and even change the reality with which it makes contact? This course introduces students to major American poets, paying particular attention to the ways in which these poets have experimented with measure in the hopes of making changes to reality. Students will be asked to think about why American poets in particular have paid such close attention to measure and, at the same time, how poetry has an impact on our imagination of how the world should be. What is the relation between what poetry allows into its form and what its form allows it to push away and ignore? What kinds of events will poets allow their poems to be influenced by, and what kinds of events in the world can poems make happen? These questions allude to the fact that we will sometimes find poetry serving as a means of contesting reality and sometimes as the kind of thing that keeps us from facing reality’s deep and difficult truths. At minimum, students who take this course will be given the time and space to read representative works of the American poetic tradition and have the chance to think more like poets about their scholarly work.'),
('ENGL 36405','Selected Topics in American Literature: Fantastic Voyages in American Literature','In the class, we will read several novels about journeys that can, in some way or another, be described as part of the literature of the fantastic—literature that features the “unreal” in order to question, critique, and imagine something other than today’s “real.” Stories of journeys heighten these themes by introducing the issues of search and of escape.'),
('ENGL 36406','American Literature and Its Appearances','In 1844, Ralph Waldo Emerson declared America to be “a poem in our eyes” that “will not wait long for metres,” giving voice to the idea—still reverberating today—that there is something poetic about the idea of America. In another of his essays, to this end, he calls for American writers to establish “an original relation to the universe” through “a poetry … of insight and not tradition.” Taken together, Emerson’s lines describe a vision for American literature in which American writers not only find new and "American" ways of writing literature but, furthermore, use literature to inspire new and more ethical ways of living in the so-called “New World.” But what place is there in American literature for those who suffered and continue to suffer from the New World project to speak to the full reality of America’s poetic ideals? This course introduces students to major figures in the American literary tradition: some who are blinded by America’s surface appearance and some who do everything in their literary power to address this blindness. Students in this course will consistently ask what makes a work of literature “American,” considering how different writers called “American” have used literature as a means of describing how America appears from their perspective as well as how America ought to be. Students who complete this course will have the tools to write fluently about different figures and genres in American literature as well as the space and time to compare representative works of American literature to the America that appears in their own eyes.'),
('ENGL 36407','Life-writing: Comprehending their lives and ours','This course invites students to engage the genre of life-writing through various mediums including novels, poetry, lyrics, oral history, and interviews. Throughout the semester, students will analyze and interrogate the genre and develop their life-writing projects.'),
('ENGL 36408','Selected Topics in American Literature: Science Fiction and Fantasy in American Literature','This course will examine how American fantasy and science fiction writers use fantastic, non-realistic storytelling: (1) to explore human relationships and psychology outside of their usual contexts, (2) to comment on social and political issues, and (3) to engage in a literary conversation with other writing in their genre. The reading list will focus more on recent and unconventional authors than on the standard list of classics.'),
('ENGL 36410','Abolitionist Literature','Building on a long tradition of transatlantic thought, contemporary abolitionists ask important social questions like: What would a society without prisons look like? What does it mean to defund the police? Can the United States? criminal justice system be reformed? ?Abolitionist Literature? works backwards to uncover the philosophical, literary, and cultural currents that birthed the abolitionist movement today. In exploring abolitionism?s literary history, we?ll better understand the successes and failures of different abolitionist strategies, how contemporary abolitionism developed, and what an abolitionist future might look like. We?ll begin by reading contemporary non-fiction writers including Ruth Wilson Gilmore and Angela Davis, moving backwards to examine abolition in twentieth-century fiction by examining writers such as John Edgar Wideman and Chester Himes, before finally exploring the nineteenth-century roots of abolitionism through writers such as Frederick Douglass, James Williams, David Walker, Harriet Jacobs, and Harriet Beecher Stowe.'),

('ENGL 36502','Literatures of Globalization: Forms of Transnational Intimacy','This course introduces students to the concept of globalization through the frame of intimacy and emotions. What kind of new intimacies are born within transnational families that speak multiple languages? What kind of misunderstanding and alienation is produced when words like ?homosexual? do not exist in one language but are crucial to the identity and growth of a multilingual character? When families and communities are affected by tragedies born of capitalism, what can and cannot be talked about, and what is the effect of those silences? When adults are traumatized by poverty, war, colonization, or migration to the point of avoiding talking about their experiences, how do their children understand themselves emotionally and culturally? When traditional family units are unable to provide the necessary support structures to meet a young person?s needs, what do those individuals have to do and understand to find different roots with their chosen kin? We?ll think together about issues of gender, sexuality, identity, food, and emotional connection through the novels and poetry that dramatize the impact of globalized experience.'),

We will consider the ways in which these writers portray issues such as intimacy, sexuality, home, place, empowerment, and self-invention, as well as how they chronicle migration, illness, care, loss, violence, division, connection, and success. By reading a diverse spectrum of writers, we''ll enlarge our sense of what is possible and what is significant in women''s writing today.'),

Due to his status as perhaps one of the last American writers to provocatively be deemed “genius,” critics are still poring over and sifting through Wallace’s “difficult gifts,” as Zadie Smith called them. The course will primarily consist of working our way through Infinite Jest. We will analyze its structural facets (Wallace’s editor once described its organization as like a “piece of glass… dropped from a great height”), its theoretical concerns (e.g. tennis, continental philosophy, avant-garde film, addiction, depression), and what its dystopian fascinations say about the social and political landscape of our present.'),

Equi''s inventive lean poems speak back to revolutionary Williams, as he spoke to her, as both of them to us. Eady''s recent project on Phyllis Wheatley speaks back to Hayden''s "Letter from Phyllis Wheatley," and both of them to us. Auden''s generous wit, personal and political, spoke to multi-dimensional Matthews, as both of them speak to us. Both Equi and Eady will also visit our class. This literal and figurative talking will inform our readings and discussions, as well as two essays, a mid-term project, final project, and your constant participation.'),
('ENGL 36520','Contemporary Postcolonial Literature','This course covers poems, plays, short stories, films, and novels.

The focus will be the way sexism and patriarchy infect both traditional societies and the white colonizers.'),
('ENGL 36525','New World Seminar','The immigrant experience has been richly represented in American literature since the beginning of the 20th c. Numerous narratives, in fiction and non-fiction, chart the dynamics, variations, and stages of the migration experience focused around the ur-concept of the "American Dream” and the process of "assimilation/acculturation" by which immigrants "become Americans," espousing promises of a new life. These diverse narratives constitute a fundamental part of American cultural history. More recent works also challenge the literary canon, defined by national boundaries, questioning mainstream values and representation of American identity. The New World Seminar pays special attention to a complex dynamic of cosmopolitan cities; the pull of cross-continental connections; points of tension characteristic of lives that strive to bridge two worlds, the country of origins and the adopted homeland; and the cultural impact of the massive and prolonged displacement. Many prominent, internationally recognized writers highlight the pain and conflicts resulting from such displacement, but they also explore new options and possibilities contained in the richness of bi-cultural, in-between, and trans-national identities'),

('ENGL 36602','Selected Topics in Anglophone Literature: British and Irish Modernism','Between 1890 and 1930, the British and Irish public experienced a staggering number of social and political upheavals. The Second Boer War, World War I, and the partition of Ireland signaled both the end and the failure of the empire project; the passage of the Representation of the People Act enacted (partial) women’s suffrage; while the rapid transformation of technology and the decline in traditional social, political, and religious values left the public with a sense of alienation and incoherence. Modernist authors valued formal innovation and experimentation in their response to these events, creating a new literature to properly chronicle a fractured modernity. In this course, we will read Ford Madox Ford’s The Good Soldier, Rebecca West’s The Return of the Soldier, Virginia Woolf’s The Waves, selections from James Joyce’s Dubliners, as well as poetry by T.S. Eliot and W.B. Yeats. At the end of the semester, we will read Zadie Smith’s N/W and reflect on the influence and legacy of this rich artistic period'),
('ENGL 36603','Selected Topics in Anglophone Literature: Literature and Suicide','Strictly speaking, no one can testify to the physical and psychological experience of suicide—perhaps this is what has made the subject so prone to literary expression. This course will begin in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, where an anonymous author wrote the first known suicide text: “Dispute between a man and his Ba.” We will then consider Hindu, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic texts on suicide before looking at four major revolutions in the modern understanding of voluntary death: the invention of “suicide,” a sympathetic and progressive word coined by Sir Thomas Browne in 1643; the Romantic obsession with self-destruction; the modernist challenge to religious and Romantic approaches to suicide; and finally the reassessment of suicide in a clinical context and the subsequent phenomenon of “suicide memoirs.” Authors include Sophocles, Shakespeare, Goethe, Mishima, Chopin, Woolf, Larsen, Soyinka, Plath, Sarah Kane, and Kay Redfield Jamison.'),
('ENGL 36604','Selected Topics in Anglophone Literature: Postcolonial Literature','Emphasis on struggle: the struggles of the captive to separate from an oppressive and seductive captor.

We will study the historical eras and political climates that have shaped Mexican cultural production -- from Mesoamerica and colonialism, revolution and postcolonialism, to the present day. We will consider how each of these historical stages has influenced Mexican literature, and will analyze the methods with which contemporary Mexican authors continue to grapple with questions of national identity in an era marked by immigration, globalization, and political crisis. Readings and film viewings may include works such as those by Luis Buñuel, Rosario Castellanos, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Juan Rulfo, Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, Laura Esquivel, Valeria Luiselli, and Yuri Herrera.'),

We will read a sampling of popular memoirs, recovery narratives, ethnic-identity stories, substance-abuse sagas, trauma memoirs, conversion narratives, and coming-of-age stories. Most of these required readings will be drawn from non-U.S. traditions and will include writings by memoirists from the Caribbean, the Middle East, China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.

('ENGL 36902','Selected Topics in Language, Writing and Rhetoric: New Media Fairy Tales','Fairy tales, historically told to entertain or caution children against danger, have migrated through time and been reinvented on social media platforms like Twitter, Tik Tok, and Instagram. The evolution of these age-old stories has broadened the audience, purpose, and arrangement of these tales, but the old themes—evil queens, isolated princesses, and brave heroes persist. This course will investigate how traditional fairy tales have evolved in the context of new media and analyze whether @redridinghood is still warning us about #bigbadwolves.'),
('ENGL 36903','Selected Topics in Language, Writing and Rhetoric: Students'' Right to Their Own Language','In 1974, the now-renowned resolution on “Students’ Right to Their Own Language” was adopted by leaders of the largest national organization on college writing (the Executive Committee of the Conference on College Composition and Communication). This resolution not only affirms the validity of all students’ dialects; it further asserts that “The claim that any one dialect is unacceptable amounts to an attempt of one social group to exert its dominance over another” and calls for teachers to gain “experiences and training that will enable them to respect diversity and uphold the right of students to their own language.” More than forty years later, the resolution remains far from common knowledge and practice. This class examines the research undergirding the SRTOL resolution and explores the (often controversial) efforts in the field of composition and rhetoric to reignite its mission.'),
('ENGL 36904','Rhetoric of Social Movements: Queer Liberation','This course examines the verbal and non-verbal rhetorical strategies of groups and individuals attempting to effect social change and the counter-strategies of those who oppose them. We look at how social movements attempt to transform perceptions of social reality, alter the self-perception of protestors, legitimize the movement, prescribe courses of action, mobilize for action, and sustain the movement. We begin by understanding how the rhetorics of social movements operate by looking at three time periods in the United States: the emergence of gay identity and early homophile societies (late 1800s-1960s), the emergence of the Gay Liberation movement post-Stonewall (1969s-1980s), and the response to the AIDS crisis (late 1980s-1990s). We then move to examining contemporary topics in LGBTQ+ studies, including the fight for marriage equality, anti-trans legislation, intersections of oppressions, LGBTQ+ content in schools, and others. Students will choose a contemporary topic in the fight for queer liberation and examine the rhetorical techniques used, from songs and slogans to television and social media'),
('ENGL 36905','Selected Topics in Language, Writing and Rhetoric: Writing Center Theory and Practice','An overview of writing center history, theory, and practice to prepare students to work with writers one-to-one or in small groups in a range of learning environments. Emphasis on writing center programs with applications to community and adult literacy programs and teacher-student conferencing. Students will learn to interpret the relationship between a writing center’s model, mission, and staff tutorial practices. Students will learn approaches to facilitating conversation with writers from diverse cultural, language, and literacy backgrounds, composing for a wide range of rhetorical situations. Readings and lectures will be contextualized through critical reflection on writing center observations and in-class collaborative work.'),
('ENGL 36906','#HotLaborSummer: Labor Management/Working Class Rhetorics','The U.S. labor movement is experiencing a surge of new growth. Workers at major companies like Amazon and Starbucks are unionizing. Summer 2023 saw strikes from the WGA and SAG-AFTRA, hotel workers in LA, and a very near strike by UPS Teamsters. Higher education itself is one of the labor movement hot spots. Will 2024 bring a new #HotLaborSummer? This surge presents a series of critical rhetorical situations with high and immediate stakes: how can workers convince their coworkers to unionize, or to go on strike? How can workers convince others to support their strikes? During an organizing drive or a contract campaign, workers and employers wage rhetorical battle with one another during class struggle. An enormous amount of writing is produced: press coverage, social media posts, bargaining updates, emails, and more. In this class, we?ll examine the different rhetorical strategies and genres that organized workers use to achieve their goals, with a focus on contemporary movements and current events, alongside key historical works of working class rhetoric and rhetorical scholarship. Students will choose a particular labor struggle at the beginning of the summer term and analyze the rhetorics at play in a series of scaffolded activities culminating in a final project.'),
('ENGL 36907','Introduction to Digital Humanities','The course provides foundational digital literacy skills and hands-on experience by introducing students to digital methods and tools for the humanities, including text analysis, digital archiving, digital mapping, and web development.

('ENGL 36908','Digital Rhetoric','Digital Rhetoric focuses on the design and circulation of digital artifacts in 3 primary areas: websites, social media networks, and digital content production (text, audio, images, video, etc.). In this course, students will design and write the content for a website to provide resources or information for a social movement/campaign, a hobby/area of interest, or for a creative/artistic endeavor. In other words, students will (1) produce digital content that is (2) shared through a website and (3) promoted through a social network. These pragmatic activities provide the framework for understanding rhetorical theory as it relates to digital environments, and how rhetorical theory informs the design, circulation, and attention economics of digital production.'),
('ENGL 36909','Working Class and Labor Movement Rhetoric','The U.S. labor movement is experiencing a surge of new growth. Workers at major companies like Amazon and Starbucks are unionizing. In 2023 alone, we saw strikes from Hollywood writers and actors, hotel workers in LA, the “Big 3” automakers, and a very near strike by UPS workers. Higher education itself is one of the labor movement hot spots, with graduate student workers, undergraduate workers, and even student athletes forming new unions. This surge presents a series of critical rhetorical situations with high and immediate stakes: how can workers convince their coworkers to unionize, or to go on strike? How can workers convince others to support their strikes, especially workers in service professions like teachers and nurses? During an organizing drive or a contract campaign, workers and employers wage rhetorical battle with one another during class struggle. An enormous amount of writing is produced. In this class, we’ll examine the different rhetorical strategies and genres that organized workers use to achieve their goals, with a focus on contemporary movements and current events, alongside key historical works of working class rhetoric and rhetorical scholarship.'),

As such, we will trace the many ways Black characters are affected, consciously or unconsciously, by the natural settings within which they move. Students will be instructed on how to appreciate that certain characters are shaped by their proximity to the natural environment, and how such portrayals serve as an outlet for Black writers to explore race relations and the African American struggle for freedom and self-representation.

('ENGL 37506','Maternal Narratives','Simone de Beauvoir wrote that maternity is “a strange compromise of narcissism, altruism, dream, sincerity, bad faith, devotion, and cynicism.” In this course we will explore that strange compromise through the nonfiction literature of motherhood, focusing especially on 20th- and 21st-century American essays and memoirs. We will pay particular attention to how writers have rendered the complexity, ambivalence, and contradictory nature of motherhood and the narratives that surround it. How have authors depicted in language what some have felt to be the indescribable? How have they fulfilled or resisted the ideologies and mythologies ascribed to the mother figure? What does it mean to queer the maternal? Such are just some of the questions we will consider. Primary texts may include selections from works such as The Woman Warrior by Maxine Hong Kingston, Sister/Outsider by Audre Lorde, Of Woman Born by Adrienne Rich, This Bridge Called My Back by Cherríe Moraga and others, The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson, Guidebook to Relative Strangers by Camille Dungy, Motherhood by Sheila Heti, Tell the Truth and Shame the Devil by Lezley McSpadden (the mother of Michael Brown), and Breathe: A Letter to my Sons by Imani Perry.'),

We will explore the strategies that playwrights use to represent, categorize, know, and speak of and for racialized subjects. In this course, we will attend closely to primary texts. It is important to be able to speak about a text—ideas it expresses, how it is structured, its relationship to other texts within its genre or form, its relationship to historical events, its material history—with precision and concision. We will engage with texts through weekly seminar discussions, critical readings, and—perhaps—short written assignments.'),
('ENGL 37604','Cinematic World Building','In this course will consider the ways in which films and television shows construct distinct worlds through visual techniques and storytelling. By turning a critical eye to the concept of world building, we will seek to understand how this technique works, as well as how this aesthetic inquiry helps to shed light upon, and gain greater understanding of, our own world and how we move through it. In addition to the relevant examples of world building found in the science fiction and fantasy genres, we will also consider films that more closely resemble this world. We will also crowd source supplemental examples from the expertise of our class. We might even examine a video game or two.

However, beyond just literature about nature, this course will examine how ecology and nature have become complicated in the 21st century, the age of the Anthropocene (don’t worry, we will define Anthropocene and other key terms). In the 21st century, humans are now confronted with a growing awareness of their impact on the earth, its environments, and its non-human inhabitants. From this perspective, how does one meaningfully engage with climate change, ecological collapse, ecological justice, and non-human beings in literature, art, and culture? How do we think about the climate crisis? How do we think about nature? How do we write about the climate crisis? How can the study of ecopoetics actually help us think about the complicated, interconnected social and environmental challenges of the 21st century at large? Ultimately, in this class, we will discuss these profound questions raised by the study of ecopoetics, questions of what it means to be human, to live in an organized society, on a finite earth, now, and 100 years from now.'),

('ENGL 39104','New Urban Fiction','Many literary theorists show that the novel has always been the literary form of urban life. It came to prominence wherever cities grew in the eighteenth century. As we come to the nineteenth century, certain cities take on a literary character. Some are even treated to a literary version, often attached to the name of an author: Balzac’s Paris, Dickens’ London, Dostoevsky’s Saint Petersburg. In the twentieth century, New York joins the club and overtakes imperial metropolitan areas, to the extent that even boroughs have authors’ names attached to them: Edit Wharton’s Manhattan, James Baldwin’s Harlem, Paul Auster’s Brooklyn.As we enter the new century, new contestants have emerged. The literary cities are no longer exclusive to Europe and North America. Around the world, many countries shrugged off their colonial past in the last century, established their own literary voice, their particular literary rendition of their cities. Within half a century a great amount of fiction written in metropolitan areas of non-Western cultures appeared. Now we can confidently talk about Salman Rushdie’s Bombay, Naguib Mahfouz’s Cairo, Vargas Llosa’s Lima.This course is an overview of this evolution, with focus on new literary metropolis. We will start off discussing theories pertinent to city and the novel. Those theories will give us the analytical toolbox we need for talking about the stories. I select six cities (Lima, Istanbul, Cairo, Calcutta, Kiev, Beirut), and will assign six novels written by authors (Mario Vargas Llosa, Orhan Pamuk, Naguib Mahfouz, Amitav Ghosh, Andrey Kurkov, Rabih Alameddine) whose names have come to represent those cities. We discuss these books within the context of the new urban fiction.'),

The texts covered in this reading-intensive seminar include novels by Tomás Rivera, Jamaica Kincaid and Chang-Rae Lee; short stories by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Natalie L. M. Petesch; plays by Martyna Majok and David Henry Hwang; and a selection of poems by Rodolfo Anaya, Gloria Anzaldúa, Czeslaw Milosz, and Simon J. Ortiz.'),
('ENGL 49011','Internet Writing: Technology and Contemporary Fiction','In a world of accelerating and abstract information, how is literature supposed to render sensations that, in David Foster Wallace’s terms, are “just too fast and huge and all interconnected” to do more than barely “sketch”? This course will address how literature has become situated in a vastly interconnected technological system, represented most notably by the Internet and its related innovations. We will ask: how does an increasing reliance on mediated systems for romantic fulfilment, economic stability, and self-definition manifest in literary art? How might literature depict relationships on “chat” networks, financial drama tied to fluid shifts in global capital, or identities forged through digital modifications? Can literature function like an Internet virus, an unrequited DM? This course will survey fiction from roughly the last three decades, tracing the charged relationship between technology and literary expression, culminating in the Internet as a shared, epochal phenomenon. Fiction works will span from cyberpunk premonitions of the Internet in William Gibson’s Neuromancer (the origin of the term “cyberspace”), to the mundane side of online millennialism in Tao Lin’s Shoplifting from American Apparel. Along the way, we’ll read Amie Barrodale on tracking web paramours (“William Wei”), Don DeLillo on global capital run amok (Cosmopolis), David Foster Wallace on broadcast trauma (“The Suffering Channel”), and graphic novels depicting squalid, yet virtually supercharged urban landscapes (Ghost in the Shell and Transmetropolitan). We will also touch on science fiction, including work by Alice B. Sheldon and Samuel Delany, employing images of the “cyborg” to presciently address issues of gender, race, and sexuality through a “posthuman” lens. The course will entail regular blackboard posts, a midterm paper, and either a final paper or creative final project.'),
('ENGL 49012','Medieval Bodies','Medieval Bodies'),
('ENGL 49013','Melodrama','Melodrama began as particular theatrical form in 18th century France, flourished in the 19th century, and became an array of conventions and modes of expression employed in film, politics, and literature. It has come to occupy an important place in critical analysis of culture. This course will examine theatrical and cinematic melodramas, the melodramatic mode in fiction and politics, and the use of melodrama as a scholarly critical lens.'),
('ENGL 49014','Shakespeare as Dramatist','How great a dramatist is Shakespeare really, and what does it mean to be a great dramatist? Are there special qualities in his handling of “the essentials of declaimed verse,” in its music, psychology, grammar, conflicts, originality, characterizations, directness and even deliberate obscurity that render his poetry for the stage, as well as his prose, eternally satisfying, exciting, influential and magnetic? The course will examine a number of Shakespeare’s comedies, tragedies and history plays with a view to elucidating these issues, or to working out his perpetual attraction for actors and audiences alike.—Two papers, the first fairly short, the second longer, but both focused especially on the dramatic aspects of Shakespeare’s verse and prose.'),
('ENGL 49015','The Gothic and Otherness','The Gothic and Otherness'),
('ENGL 49016','Global Modernisms','“Modernism” is one of the most significant terms in the study of literary history, and also one of the most difficult and contested. Modernism attained prominence with 19th and 20th century avant-garde artistic and literary movements, but its uses and effects extend to many places, periods, and cultures. As recent scholars in the “new modernist studies” have shown, modernism has always been a global phenomenon. In this capstone seminar, we will read works from the rise of Anglophone modernism in the early years of the 20th century; examine writers who used the vocabulary of modernism to address war, decolonization, and migration at mid-century; and trace modernism’s rejuvenated influence in the 21st century in the work of contemporary novelists.'),
('ENGL 49017','Modern Literature, Illness, and Medicine','The meteoric rise of the medical profession, starting in the late 19th century, with its strictly “materialist” approach to health--and its unprecedented separation from “spirituality” and what is now called “psychology”--has greatly transformed the very conception of the human being. From that period until now, literature, which is of course centrally concerned with characters and human experience, has both reflected and contested this modern medicalization. We will consider the literary representations of illness and doctors--and their relation to the medical versions of these--in American works, as well as a couple of European works that had great impact in the US, from the 1890s to the present'),
('ENGL 49018','Renaissance Poetry','In this course, we will be reading and discussing English poems written by Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Epics and elegies, sonnets, songs, and shorter narrative poems, everything except the epic. The poems are mostly about love – we will be thinking about how poetry remakes love into its own image, and how different poetic forms change our experience of love and of the world.'),
('ENGL 49019','Anxiety of Influence: Wright, Ellison, Baraka','Anxiety of Influence: Wright, Ellison, Baraka'),
('ENGL 49020','Between History and Memory: the Memoir in the Age of Forgetfulness','A memoir is a historical account of the past written from a personal angle. But how does the memoirist “unlock” the past? If individual memory is dynamic and ever-changing and collective histories get re-written often, what are the memoirist’s sources? How does the past come to “speak” to him or her? What are his or her obligation to historical accuracy? In this seminar, we will read memoirs, personal essays and theoretical works on memoir, memory and history. Writers will include Joan Didion, Edmund de Waal, James Baldwin, Simon de Beauvoir, Marianne Hirsch, Reinhart Koselleck and others. Midterm and final papers will be assigned.'),
('ENGL 49021','Battle of the Sexes: Sexuality, Gender, and Early Modern English Drama','This advanced undergraduate class will explore how dramatists such as Shakespeare, Middleton and Dekker, Ford, and Wycherley represent gender and its performance in early modern culture. The texts engage questions of gender and sexuality and the treatment of sexual and gender relations as a kind of battle. We will also explore varieties of gender in early modern representation including non-binary sexualities and competing forms of masculinity and femininity.'),

('ENGL 49023','Climate Writing','Climate Writing'),
('ENGL 49024','The Price of Culture, or Mythology and Ideology Behind America’s Racial Divide','This seminar will examine how African American texts offer a view of the many ways that Blacks have attempted to assimilate into the culture of the United States, and the variety of tactics that have been used to prevent their assimilation. These texts offer history lessons, African American inspired literary techniques, and philosophical concepts as roadmaps for the purpose of better understanding the racial divide in America. We will discuss a range of Black writers, such as the poets Phillis Wheatley, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Robert Hayden; the fiction writers, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin; and the playwrights, Lorraine Hansberry and Amiri Baraka. Secondary critical works will be included to inform our discussion of these writers and to assist with composing a final research paper.'),
('ENGL 49025','Bible, Myth, and Contemporary Fiction','Bible, Myth, and Contemporary Fiction'),
('ENGL 49026','American Studies','This seminar will investigate narratives that depict intimate interactions between Blacks and Whites, chiefly within an idyllic setting, one conducive, that is, to issues concerned with romance. The intention is to determine the extent to which such texts inform America’s continuing angst associated with race and sexuality that may lie behind the continuing divide between Black and White Americans. Writers of interest would include Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry David Thoreau, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Richard Wright, Amiri Baraka, James Baldwin, and William Styron.'),
('ENGL 49027','Renaissance Poetry: desire and transgression','Renaissance Poetry: desire and transgression'),
('ENGL 49028','Ulysses at 100','Published in 1922, James Joyce''s Ulysses is commonly regarded as the greatest novel of the 20th century. In this capstone seminar we will read the entirety of Ulysses as well as some other short writings by James Joyce. Our aim is to put the book into context. How did Ulysses shape English literature in the years after its publication? What does Ulysses continue to offer us now, on its hundredth anniversary? Why is it still important to read Joyce? These are some of the questions that we will ask. Evaluation for the course will be based on two longer papers as well as shorter in-class writing assignments. This course is a modified version of the 300-level course titled "James Joyce" which ran in 2015, 2017, and 2019.'),
('ENGL 49029','Introduction to Language','Introduction to Language'),
('ENGL 49030','The Aesthetics of Bling','This course explores the bizarre fantasies of the metaphysical poets alongside the parallel works of strange imagination that we have seen emerging in our own time. Some of these weird creative works contrast with the stark minimalism and plain speech that are found in a Hemingway or a Raymond Carver. We pay attention to the visual arts, especially to the painting of Kehinde Wiley, who is best known for his portrait of Barack Obama but is actually a deeply neo-baroque artist who paints men striding like Renaissance knights through the inner city.'),
('ENGL 49031','The Caribbean and the Modern Narrative','The Caribbean has experienced enormous political and social shifts in the past century. Since the end of the first World War, patterns of revolution, intervention, migration, modernization, and natural disasters have contributed to the region’s strange modernity. That is to say, because of heightened conditions, operations of the everyday seem to border on the surreal. This seminar explores how some of the region’s most important authors try to capture this everyday through storytelling. Instead of making any definitive claims about a distinctive form from the region, however, the course is more interested in studying the various forms and techniques writers have marshaled in response to the shifting realities around them. We will therefore engage with authors from a range of Caribbean islands to get a scope of the region’s diverse histories and heritages. We will also examine how global movements such as modernism operate alongside indigenized forms of the gothic, the folk, and the marvelous real within the literature.'),
('ENGL 49032','Global Autobiography','This course will provide Literature and Creative Writing majors with a basic map of world-wide life- writing. Cultural diversity within the broad tradition of memoir and autobiography is crucial to the course. I will focus on three themes: (1) struggles with body image and weight loss or gain; (2) family and social pressure to conform to cultural norms in dress and relationships; and (3) special techniques for creating a vivid "self" in writing.'),
('ENGL 49033','Romping Through the Woods: A Capstone Seminar in Writing for Teens','Young adult fiction explores the vast landscape of writing for teens. Wonderful and diverse literature will be dissected in this class with the explicit purpose of cultivating an understanding of this genre, and demonstrating the deep, underground danger in the forest of a teen''s inner psyche. The beginning of the journey starts with fairy tales. Writing for this age group requires following the same parameters for all good writing : diction; plot; character; dialogue and detail. As we romp through the forest together, you will be engaged with the skills of dissection, workshopping and revision in order to discover the primal scream of a teen. Close inspection of the literature will enable you to find a voice suitable to the stories you want to tell.'),
('ENGL 49034','Freedom Dreams: Race and Literature in America','Robin D. G. Kelley''s Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination ?is an interdisciplinary, canonical study of the black radical tradition and the intellectual and artistic pursuits for revolutionary change--freedom. This course considers the literary contributions to the black radical tradition from the 19th and 20th centuries.'),
('ENGL 49035','Restitution: Aftermaths of Trauma in Literature, Psychology and Law','Restitution: Aftermaths of Trauma in Literature, Psychology and Law'),
('ENGL 49036','Intersectionality in the Novels of James Baldwin','The class will explore issues of race, sexuality, and how these topics intersect as a reflection of America?s notion of the ?pursuit of happiness.? We will explore how patterns in the lives of his characters speak to the rights of Americans in general. We will consider how the general reader of any demographic may connect with issues raised in his works even if, at first glance, such issues may appear limited to a single social group or individual. We will explore how in his works seemingly private or narrow narrative tropes connect with larger universal themes. To do so, we will examine one of Baldwin?s plays, a short story, and three of his early novels, namely, Go Tell It on the Mountain, Another Country, and If Beale Street Could Talk.'),
('ENGL 51101','The Novel of Empire','This course will examine novels and related texts from the 1880''s through the late twentieth century from the era of high imperialism to the postcolonial period to imperial nostalgia. Through close reading and broad comparison, we''ll trace the relationships between the history of the British Empire (and others) and English-language fiction in particular, how histories and experiences of the first were written into the second. What themes and preoccupations unite works concerned with imperialism and colonialism written across this period, and in literary fields ranging from adventure stories to high modernism. We will also look at justifications and critiques of the Empire and colonialism, and the innovations of postcolonial and global anglophone writers. The reading list may include such figures as Joseph Conrad, H. Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, Olive Schreiner, E.M. Forster, Raja Rao, C.L.R. James, Graham Greene, Jean Rhys; possibly a film; and additional critical and historical readings. Requirements will include regular short writing assignments, an in-class presentation, midterm essay, and final research paper.'),
('ENGL 51102','A Literary History of Disability, Medicine, and the Social Model','This seminar introduces disability studies via the disability narrative, a genre that we will continuously theorize and critique. The field is relatively new but its concerns carry a long history. We begin with humanisms inward turn away from divine explanation. Michel de Montaigne, for example, no longer content to accept disability as a mark of God''s wrath, diligently ponders the infinity of [human] forms and our notions of physical difference. Centuries later, Friedrich Nietzsche recovers those deviating natures for the social good; far from stigma, disability is, for him, a generative exile from the stifling mainstream. Our critical perspectives on race, gender, class, and sexuality depend on these foundational theories of disability. We track our literary history by attending to the stories of disabled or disfigured bodies, from Frances Burney''s eighteenth-century account of her mastectomy to Mean Little deaf Queer (2010), Terry Galloway''s quirky memoir about her little-D deafness. Through secondary readings, we also develop a sophisticated critical apparatus from which to interpret disability in all its forms. Our primary readings may include selections from John Milton, Mary Wortley Montagu, Alexander Pope, Mary Shelley, Lord Byron, Charles Dickens, Herman Melville, and Jorge Luis Borges.'),
('ENGL 51103','Feminist Theory in Literature and Pop Culture','In this Honors Seminar, we will read interdisciplinary feminist theory drawn from psychoanalysis, sociology, anthropology, film and media as well as literary studies  all in the context of twentieth-century cultural texts. We first consider the question: What is a text? Is it a work of literature. Or can a text be a Hollywood film, a photograph, a music video, a Barbie doll. We also consider another major issue essential to the course: What is the nature of sexual difference and what does it have to do with the historical oppression of women. The course goes on to pursue many aspects of diverse women''s social experience through creative and/or culture-studies artifacts. Writings by Saphire and Kate Chopin, films directed by Maria Luisa Bemberg and Deepa Mehta, music videos produced by Madonna and Shakira, and television classics like I Love Lucy will all be under consideration. Students will be asked to read a plethora of theory texts by authors including Laura Mulvey, Nancy Chodorow, and Judith Butler. Written requirements will include a formal reading journal and two essays; students will also be asked to do research and give oral presentations.'),

('HIST 31181','Imagining Manhattan: building the island and its discourses, 1811-present','For more than two centuries Manhattan has been both the object of urban thinkers'' fantasies and a laboratory for urban movements and design strategies. Architects and urbanists in the 19th and 20th centuries imagined idealistic and dystopian plans for the great city, with roadways stacked five or ten stories high, aerial avenues of commuter airplanes, or uncontrolled speculative skyscrapers turning the city into a bleak lattice of canyons. But the island''s realized dreams were often even more audacious; among the grandest of these was the 1811 legislation of the city''s Cartesian block grid at a moment when most of the island was farmland and forest. But no more timid are a town made from towers (Rockefeller Center), a neighborhood where the Hudson recently flowed (Battery Park City), and an 800-acre populist artificial garden made from the most valuable land in the world (Central Park). This course considers the movements, ideologies, and theoretical frameworks that transformed Manhattan into the island as it continues to rise today. Field visits will supplement in-depth analysis of the city''s architecture and urban designs.  In the course''s hybrid component, students will investigate collectively and individually, the history of a particular site of their choice, engaging not only with its `original design, subsequent modifications, and present state, but also with the unrealized architectural and urban fantasies to which it has played host.'),

First, students will trace the changing definition of American Studies: Originating as a field of study with a focus primarily on the United States, the field has expanded to encompass research spanning all of the Americas, which include the disparate and often marginalized cultural zones within. Second, they will study the field relationship to twentieth-century social movements and related theoretical models and contemporary approaches to research, including Marxist theory, cultural studies, feminist theory, queer theory, post-colonial theory, and studies of ethnicities and race. Finally, the course will expose them to various research techniques necessary to conduct interdisciplinary research and produce graduate-level writing in their study of the Americas coursework. In readings and position papers, students will identify and consider methodologies across the disciplines. In the final assignment, students will implement the research methodologies discussed over the course of the semester. They will choose a topic, develop a research agenda, conduct interdisciplinary research, and write a final research proposal, with an annotated bibliography.'),

To be sure, it is a great literary achievement, a mark of pride for all Dominicans. But Juno Diaz’s remarkable Pulitzer Prize winning fiction is more than a singular accomplishment. It is a portal to a mansion of Dominican storytelling with rooms in English and Spanish, in prose fiction and feature films. Our course will visit those rooms to see how they show the history and experience of the Dominican Republic and its diaspora in the USA. In addition to Diaz’s masterpiece, we will consider writing by women such as Angie Cruz’s Dominicana and Rita Indiana’s Tentacle. No less impressive in recent years is the growth and quality of feature filmmaking in the Dominican Republic. This includes works such as Sugar, Sand Dollars, Woodpeckers, and Cocoté, among others. We will analyze these stories for what they say about Dominican experience and – equally important as works of art – how they say it. A number of questions will frame the ways we come to understand these works. How do they portray alternative views of Dominican history, culture and society to challenge official versions? To what degree does Trujillo’s 20th century dictatorship still shape aspects of the 21st century life? In what ways do the works explore how Dominican lives are influenced by race, class, and gender? How do different generations understand these issues? What role does the diaspora play in all of this? Who controls what constitutes Dominican culture? For example, how does a once despised musical genre – bachata – become a reference point for other expressive forms such as the novel and movies? How is all of this captured in three languages: Spanish, English, and Spanglish? Who gets to be in the story and who is permitted to tell it? The course will be conducted as lecture/discussions. Students will write several essays based on the readings and screenings (which are available streaming). 3 hr. 3 cr. Graduate'),

Over the last two decades, anthropologists have offered a series of theoretical and ethnographic interventions on what was originally characterized as transnational processes. Students will examine various frameworks for understanding what is emerging as a "post/911" model for understanding the regimes of power, formal and informal, that organize border crossings as "transborder," "extraterritorial," transnational, global, and so on, in what can be broadly defined as a political and economic context of neoliberalism. In doing so, we will interrogate the place of the nation-state, and the ways in which territorial, ethnic, racial, gendered, postcolonial borders are crossed or not. While clearly U.S. hegemony is at the core of this discussion, significant attention will be placed on decentering the U.S. as the axis of interpretation. Through ethnographic case studies, students will be introduced to topics such as the links between structural, gendered, and everyday violence, the politics of clandestinity, to questions on the privileging of mobility as a problematic trope of the 21st Century.'),

Then we explore the literature of migration and immigration, to and from the Americas, from the dawn of the twentieth century to the present.  We first will investigate subtle and not-so-subtle shifts in the law and language of migration at the turn of the twentieth century, as the customary influx of northern European migration to the Americas mitigates and is complemented by waves of southern Europeans, eastern European Jews and Puerto Ricans moving west and north. Next, we study the mid-century, particularly the continued immigration and emigration of Puerto Ricans and Cubans. Finally, we look at population movement through the Americas late in the century, with special attention paid to Mexican, Caribbean and South American migration and immigration, and an unusual look at indigenous ''migration.'''),

This course takes a critical approach to the concept of self-care exploring the different intellectual traditions from which it emerges, including a Black feminist lineage that positions it as a radical tool for change as well as literatures that critique it as neoliberal form of self-making. It then turns to specific ethnographic examples asking how care plays out in different places and historical moments across the Americas.

How does the legacy of colonialism shape women’s political organizing? How is women’s labor in revolutionary movements marginalized? What particular organizing strategies do women draw upon? How does gender shape women’s experience of revolution, both within and across cultures? (How) do women’s revolutionary activities contribute to a transnational feminist movement?'),
('IAS A6210','Postcolonial Caribbean Thought and Aesthetics','Ever since the arrival of Europeans, the Caribbean has been marked by repeated inflections of violence in all its forms, be it physical, cultural, epistemic, gendered, or environmental. As indigenous populations and enslaved Africans in the plantation system developed strategies for survival, new, creolized cultures of resistance began to emerge, standing against a history marked by centuries of colonialism, slavery, imperialism, nationalism, and the slow, brutal impositions of neoliberalism. This course offers an overview of these developments through a transdisciplinary approach including theory, history, literature, and music. We will discuss how writers and artists across languages spoken in the Caribbean, including its diaspora in the United States, address colonialism in their work and engage in a pan-Caribbean conversation aiming at breaking from the legacies of historical violence.'),

This course will look at the stories of slavery and its aftermaths across the Americas, paying attention to the journeys taken, by force or by choice, within and across countries, oceans, seas, and continents. We will also take into account journeys that enabled formerly enslaved people and their descendants to resist the totalizing trauma of slavery and imagine a different life for themselves and their families. We will begin with the classic slave narrative, which traces the journey from bondage to freedom. We will then turn to contemporary novels, poetry, and essays that illustrate both the physical and psychic consequences of slavery as well as the power of community and the power of imagination to create healing spaces, out of which new stories can emerge. To deepen our readings of the literary works, we will also read recent scholarship that explores the global resonance of the afterlives of slavery.'),

With endless uncertainties that are exacerbated by political turmoil, pandemic unpredictability, and climate crisis, our quotidian experiences are steeped in mutability. Transitions present us with both challenges and opportunities, not only in our everyday lives but also in our work. Within the word transition, emphasizing the prefix trans opens up avenues of thought that celebrate the in-betweenness of our state of being. Rather than focusing on the pressures to move on to the next thing (to be post-COVID, post-racial, post-colonial, as it may), tarrying in transition helps us to appreciate the difficult path toward restoring healthy relationships. This includes but is not limited to transnationalism, trans identities, transitivity, transdisciplinarity, translanguaging, transparency, transhumanism, transluminescence, translation, transliteration, transcendence, transfusion, and transmutation."

It has become common media parlance. But what does it really mean? Where is the magic? Where is the realism? As a storytelling form, how does it function? And for whom? Our course will explore how Magical Realism emerges from different communities in the Americas at different times and places. We will visit novels and films from the Caribbean, Latin America, Native America, and the African American South. Authors may include Alejo Carpentier, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Edwidge Danticat, and Jesmyn Ward, among others. Films may include Guantanamera(Cuba), Like Water for Chocolate (Mexico), and Daughters of the Dust (USA), among others. A key question will guide the course.

('IAS A6270','Slavery, Gender and Colonial Legacies in the Caribbean','This course examines the legacies of colonialism across the Caribbean, from the unspeakable violence that began with the genocide of the autochthonous communities and the enslavement of populations forcibly imported from Africa to the various modes of ideological justifications and their spiraling effects across the region over time. A focus on gender will explore questions of miscegenation, women’s refusal of forced reproduction, and various modes of rebellion that culminated with the Haitian Revolution—an event that, like a domino effect, dismantled an entire system across the Americas and intervened in renewed debates on human rights. We will also see how colonialism is not a thing of the past—it persists to this day through legislation, state-sponsored violence, extractive economies, environmental depredation, and anti-Black narratives. Classic and recent scholarship in history, social theory, cultural studies, environmental studies, and literary works will animate our class discussions and writing assignments over the semester.'),

('IAS 31408','Between Heaven and Hell: The History of Utopian and Dystopian Thought','This advanced, interdisciplinary course examines the historical legacies and contemporary relevance of utopian and dystopian thought. Stretching from Plato’s Republic through Thomas Moore’s Utopia and Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis, all the way up Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward and the “cyber-utopianism,” as Evgeny Morozov has called it, of Silicon Valley today, utopian thought is a vast and varied phenomenon. Its aspirations have informed philosophical and political treatises, mobilized social movements, and borrowed deeply into popular culture. The same could be said for its shadow discourse, dystopianism, which in the current age of global warming, refugee crises, and a resurgent neo-fascism, has gone from being the purview of science fiction to the stuff of newspaper headlines. The eerie contemporary relevance of Margaret Atwood’s A Handmaid’s Tale is a case in point. Highlighting the ways in which utopian and dystopian works have expressed both our highest hopes and our basest fears—about society, technology, and the environment, among other things—this course shows how speculative thought interacts with real-world contexts and consequences. It will demonstrate how utopian and dystopian ideas more often reflect this world than the one that is to come. Students with interests history, literature, and philosophy, as well as those interested in any of the social movements that have been connected to utopian and dystopian discourses—such as progressivism, feminism, anti-racism—are encouraged to attend.'),
('IAS 31409','Gentrification Globalized','We live above all in an urban world, one marked by spatial, economic and racial segregation as well as political and cultural suppression and displacement. This course examines gentrification both from a theoretical and an advocacy perspective. Gentrification and displacement are not only threatening the right to the city of working class and even middle class New Yorkers, who are being evicted and excluded from neighborhoods across the city by an apparently natural, economic, process of transformation. Gentrification and displacement are a global phenomenon, and they are the symptoms of planning strategies implemented through public-private policy partnerships. Public officials, real estate lobbying groups, private consulting firms, and financial institutions as well as “gentrifiers” play active roles in the redevelopment schemes that have restructured central cities and urban neighborhoods across the country, indeed across the world. In this course, we will examine various definitions of gentrification in order to unpack a word we seem to hear everywhere but whose meaning has been transformed, especially in the media, to obscure the relationship between gentrification and displacement and to obscure the actors advocating for, leading or supporting gentrification processes. Gentrification has not gone uncontested. We will explore resistance to gentrification from the local neighborhood perspective as well as investigate the linkages organizers have created to build trans-local and international organizing efforts, especially around the right to the city and the right not to be excluded from the city. This course is meant to be a 200-300 level course and will address the following themes: Gentrification defined; Gentrification Gglobalized; The logic of disinvestment and reinvestment; Agents of transformation; The production and self-representation of “gentrifiers”; Culture, consumption and the new middle class; Resistance from the local to global.'),

Most importantly, by the end of the course, students will be able to identify specific criteria that help them to gauge which books and/or graphic novels are appropriate for varying aged youth. As such, this course is geared as much towards teacher and parents as it is towards those who love, but also struggle to read. For interestingly, half of Young Adult (“YA”) readers are adults. Drawing on both canonical theoretical texts around psychology of children and young adults (i.e. J.A. Appleyard; J. Campbell; S. Edwards; E. Erikson; M. Montessori; P. Freire; J. Piaget), but also more recent work (i.e. C. Ní Bhroin and P. Kennon; G. Mendes; M. Weiner; C. del Valle Schorske), students shall determine why certain novels attract young adults’ attention and why others do not. We also look at how certain books seem to work for a wide range of young adult readers: how despite outside appearances, they deal quite poignantly with intersectional questions of social class, gender, and race.'),

How do institutionalized sexism and institutionalized racism lead to limited opportunities for Latinas? Why are so many Black women dying in childbirth? Why are so many Native women victims of sexual assault? Why is our food grown by farmworkers who are not protected by the same laws against sexual harassment as other occupations? Why are many of our consumer goods made by low-wage female workers overseas? In this course, students will develop their sociological imaginations to answer urgent questions about gender inequality, both intersectional and global. We will explore topics such as childhood socialization, sexuality, racism, migration, and gendered labor in both domestic and international contexts. First, students will learn prevailing sociological theories on the ways children learn and are taught about gender and sexuality. Next, we will examine gendered institutions like the family, schools, work, and the global economy. In particular, students will learn how gendered interactions and gendered institutions produce difference and domination in various contexts. Throughout the semester, we will explore the gendered dynamics of sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, and nation through art, music, and film. Course assignments will introduce students to conducting sociological research in their own communities'),

('IAS 50000','Inventing The Americas','This course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the study of the Americas. Whether defined by geography, culture. language, ethnicity, history, politics, or literature, the Americas have been a contested space for hundreds of years. We will examine some of the ways in which the Americas have been constructed, defined, redefined since the time of Columbus (and before). We will pay particular attention to the ways in which the Americas served as both a terminus and a turning point for what is generally known as ''the western tradition''; in other words, we will examine the residues of the world in the new world, as well as the importation of the new world into the old. Touching upon some of the topics that have come to define the history of the Americas, we will discuss the science(s) of exploration; the imaginaries of the new world and the old; the politics and economics of empire and colonialism; the cruelties of invasion, conquest, and slavery. The transformations of ecology and biology, the contours of nationalism and transnationalism; as well as the more recent phenomenon of globalization.

('IAS 50300','Geopol Diplmcy Americas','This course serves as an introduction to the geopolitics, that is the spatial expressions of power. that have shaped the geographic boundaries, cultural and racial representations and political and economic relations among the nations of the Americas. David Slater, writes in Geopolitics an the Post-colonial States: "It can be argued that US imperialism has always followed a double movement of erecting and policing boundaries, and of breaking down borders both internally and externally so as to open up new spaces of unfettered expansion" (30). We will examine the construction of the US hegemony in the Americas, exploring continuities and critical conjunctures that have shaped relations among the nations of the Americas; we will also examine specific countries more closely through the close reading of primary and secondary sources. As a class, we will also attempt to extend the idea of geopolitics as it relates to protest, resistance and the structuring of people''s everyday life.'),

('INTL 21005','Human Rights: Theory and Practice','Over the past 60 years, we have seen “human rights” evolve from an abstract philosophical discourse to an increasingly robust realm of international law and transnational activism. Yet numerous challenging questions remain: what specific claims deserve to be placed within the all-important category of human rights? If we assign this status to many rights (for example economic, environmental, or social rights), do we minimize the overall power of the discourse of human rights? What, if any, are the proper rational foundations for human rights? Are human rights a subtle cover for Western domination and do they supplant alternative, non-Western cultural and legal traditions? How are human rights to be enforced, given the absence of a world government or military force? What is the best strategy for vulnerable populations to seek and secure human rights? This course begins at the most fundamental level, examining what we tend to mean when we say “human rights” and aims at exploring some of the cultural, legal, and political debates central to the discourse of human rights (“human rights in theory”). At the same time, we will go beyond the theoretical level by examining contemporary cases and events which bring these questions into greater focus (“human rights in practice”). To this end, the course materials will include a number of films, documentaries, and artistic productions that make evident the dramatic complexities that characterize the conversation concerning “human rights.” You will be expected to watch the assigned films and clips in preparation for class discussions.'),

The thesis of the course is that theatre in Israel—both Hebrew and Arabic—is “political” theatre; almost all the drama written and produced over the past 120 years is a sharp comment on what is going on the society—politics, religion, societal fault-lines (Palestinian Arabs, Jews from Arab lands, Western- and Eastern-European Jews, native-born Israelis), the Holocaust, the army and the wars, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Zionism—indeed, identity itself. Theatre is the prism through which Israeli society is refracted. We begin with “foundational” plays of the early twentieth century, in the context of the social and political dynamics of that era, which influenced the development of the history of Israeli theatre; thence, representative plays from different periods, examining each in terms of the internal literary dynamics of the drama, and in terms of the political, historical, and societal dynamics of the period in which the play was written and produced.'),

Join us as we explore this musical diversity in an ensemble setting, studying and performing a range of secular, folk, and religious Jewish music such as klezmer (Eastern European Jewish instrumental and semi-improvised music), chazzanut (cantorial singing), piyyut (liturgical poetry), Yiddish musical theater and folk songs, Ladino ballads of the Sephardic (Spanish) Jews, the system of maqam (Middle Eastern music) and traditional Arabic-influenced Jewish music, Hasidic nigunim (mystical worldless melodies), Mizrahi (Jews of the Middle Eastern) pop music, as well as present-day musicians innovating and expanding the contours of what Jewish music can be in the 21st century. Along the way, we’ll learn about the mystical power of music and its deep connection to Jewish history, worldview, and the Jewish way of life. Performance, both public and private, will be a crucial component of this class and will serve to allow students to experience the transformative power of music as a window to past migrations, as a meditative practice, and as oral and aural culture. Students do not need to be Jewish or have any background in Judaism to participate, but as this is a music performance ensemble, preference will be given to students with an instrumental and/or vocal music background.'),

('JWST 31911','Primo Levi: Prisoner, Survivor, Scientist','Primo Levi is a towering figure of Italian literature, whose career spans over four decades and crosses multiple genres and forms. Heir of a long-established Jewish household from Turin, Levi was deported to Auschwitz where he managed to survive thanks to his professional training as a chemist. Years later, he was able to tell his story in two of the most consequential memoirs about the Holocaust, life in the concentration camp and the long, painful journey back home. In the final instalment of this trilogy, he investigated the sense of guilt and shame of a society that has not been able to process the events of a not-so-distant past. Although the name of Levi is primarily associated with this part of his production, the legacy of the Italian writer is much wider. Repeatedly, Levi reflects on the dignity and the beauty of a passionate commitment to our job as an alternative to postmodern alienation; he explores the several challenges that advancements in technology create for mankind on a daily basis. In this class, we set to survey Levi’s multifaceted work with readings from Survival in Auschwitz, The Drowned and the Saved, The Periodic Table, The Six Days and Other Tales, and The Monkey’s Wrench. Secondary sources include selections from Angier, Gordon, Pugliese, and Farrell.'),

To study African animation is to look at Africa through new lenses, examine the continent?s relation to the world, technological development in film and media, and questions of racial and minority representations. Animation like gaming, virtual and augmented reality are ever present and defining our today?s mediated experience through screens and relationships to others. The course takes you on a discovery journey, from Moustapha Alassane, the father of African animation, the Congolese Jean Michel Kibushi, the South African William Kentridge, to the talent of the current generation whose work features in Kizazi Moto: Generation Fire (2023), an anthology of Africanfuturist animated short film series distributed Disney+ and was produced by South Africa-based Triggerfish studios.'),

There are lots of movie adaptations of Shakespeare (997 according to IMDB), but this class will look at films that--instead of being adaptations--are rip-off, parodies, or send-ups of Shakespeare, movies that take Shakespeare''s plots and characters in completely new and unexpected directions, in order to examine Shakespeare''s place in popular culture not simply as the author of museum pieces, but as a playwright whose stories are endlessly malleable and still poignant today. Along the way we shall look at points where Shakespeare intersects with different genres and periods of film history, giving us a chance to study and discuss more than just instances of filmic Bardolotry.. Some of the movies we will look at include the 1957 Samurai classic "Throne of Blood" (Macbeth), the 1958 science fiction movie "Forbidden Planet" (The Tempest) and the Bob and Doug Mackenzie comedy from 1983 "Strange Brew" (Hamlet).'),

It is not a process of communicating to ?everyone,? but a process of communicating to the ?right people? whose behaviors and whose own communications will affect others. At times, public relations practitioners work with professional shapers of opinion: securities, technology, and economic analysts, cultural and fashion reviewers, and, nearly always, the media. At other times, public relations practitioners work to reach the Innovators and Early Adopters of the classic Production Adoption Curve. In recent years, the development of social and new media technologies has added another ? and evolving ? dimension to marketplace influentials.'),

There is an old saying that "there is no disputing about taste", but in fact we all have debates about our artistic preferences.  Are there facts about good and bad art that reasoned discussion can discover?  How are debates about art different from debates about science, logic, or ethics?  Why do we care about art in the way that we do?  Topics covered may include representation, taste, the authority of criticism, artistic sincerity and authenticity, and the relationship between the criteria for argument and agreement in aesthetics and in domains such as logic and science.  Authors covered may include Kant, Hume, Danto, Cavell, Fried, and Scruton'),

Reasonable people understand that theories which invoke conspiracies are likely to be false.  But conspiracy theories typically provide unifying explanations.  Further, there is often no obvious evidence against conspiracy theories.  So why are they likely to be false?  This class will include contemporary and/or historical philosophical readings, and may include topics such as belief revision and logic, skepticism, topics in philosophy of science such as confirmation and explanation, and topics in cognitive science such as cognitive bias and fallacy.'),

By this survey we will also gain an understanding of phenomenology''s potential for interdisciplinary application in areas such as artistic creativity, engineering/design, and the social sciences.'),
('PHIL 31109','Personal Identity','This course discusses what it is to be a person, and related questions about the unity of persons at a time and across time. Does personal identity across time consist in the continuity of memories, beliefs, and psychological traits? Or is it a matter of the continuity of the body, or the persistence of an immortal and immaterial soul? Does personal identity matter as much as we think it does? Do we possess as much unity as we think we do? We will discuss these questions in light of actual cases, like brain experiments and psychopathologies, as well as science fiction cases like "Star Trek" transporters and religious cases involving immortal beings.'),
('PHIL 31111','Life Lessons from Dead Philosophers','We turn to philosophy for the same reasons we travel: to see the world from a different perspective, to unearth hidden beauty, and to find new ways of being. We want to learn how to embrace wonder. Face regrets. Sustain hope. From Socrates and ancient Athens to Simone de Beauvoir and twentieth-century Paris, this course explores philosophers (and places) who help us navigate today’s chaotic times.'),

('PHIL 31114','Cities & Urban Life','Cities are known by their profiles: bridges, streets, or skyline: Venice, Paris, or New York.  Every city joins stability to flux in ways peculiar to itself, though each resembles others because the elements of social structure are common to all.  Each is a web of social relations, a clamorous machine of systems and networks; none is merely an aggregate of people going their separate ways. No one doubts the reality of individuals or the whole: yet core systems—families, businesses, schools, and churches—do a society’s work while supplying contexts for personal development and the initiatives expressing individual character and talent.  Discount systems while emphasizing individuality and you ignore the contexts where people live, work, and dream.  Discount networks of overlapping systems—each defended against all or some others—and you fail to see barriers that divide and stratify societies. These features are common to settlements of every size, though cities express them in distinctive ways:  orchestras play music too elaborate for a quartet; city densities promote collaborations unachievable in simpler towns. The class will consider cities as they are, and ought to be.'),

('PHIL 31122','Contemporary Phenomenology','This course addresses philosophical issues that are of common interest to both classical phenomenology (e.g., Brentano, Husserl, Heidegger, Stein, Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Arendt, Deleuze) and the contemporary sciences of mind (philosophy of mind, epistemology, metaphysics, neuroscience, psychology, and relevant disciplines in the social sciences). The aim is to introduce students to the burgeoning field of “applied phenomenology” as well as to the methods of comparative investigation of historical texts in the history of philosophy. Some questions considered in the course will be: What is the nature of consciousness, action, personal identity, gender identity, and interpersonal understanding? How do first-person and third-person methods of investigation bear on the investigation of these topics?'),
('PHIL 31123','Do We Have Free Will?','What is free will?  Do we have it?  Can we believe in free will without denying what science tells us about the universe?  Some philosophers believe that everything we do is preordained by the laws of cause and effect, and that this means we do not have free will. If we do not have free will, does that mean that nobody deserves to be punished for immoral actions—and that nobody deserves to be praised for noble actions?  Can there be morality of any kind in a universe without free will?  And could it be that the discovery of quantum mechanics, and the indeterministic universe it reveals, mean that we have free will after all—or does this just mean that some of our actions may really be random, as if we were rolling dice to decide what to do with our lives?'),
('PHIL 31124','Metaphysics','Metaphysics is arguably the most fundamental type of philosophy, for it is the subject area where one confronts entirely basic -- yet incredibly rich -- questions.  For example, metaphysics is concerned with the very nature of being and existence, of time and change, personal identity, free will and determinism, and object-property or part-whole relations.  This course introduces students to historical and contemporary debates on such metaphysical issues.  Students will become acquainted with major positions on various key topics, learn how to critique and respond to arguments, and ultimately construct and defend their own positions within these debates.'),
('PHIL 31125','Philosophy and Afrofuturism','This course will focus on select philosophical topics in Afrofuturism and Black Futurism. The term ‘Afrofuturism’ refers to the thought and practice of Africana peoples projecting themselves into narratives of the future as well as conceptualizing the role of technology in ways relevant to Africana and Black Identity. As such we will focus on several key themes in Afrofuturism under three headings: the semantic-ontological, the aesthetic, and the ethico-political. We will pursue answers to certain questions such as “What is ‘Afrofuturism?”, “How does Afrofuturism challenge the political and historical erasure of African identity and history?”, “What exactly is ‘black’ about Black Music?”, “How does futurism manifest itself in non-narrative form?”, “What is the difference between Afrofuturism and ‘Black Futurism?”, “What are some futures for Afrofuturism?” Artists and thinkers that we will be engaging include philosophers W.E.B Dubois and Harvey Cormier; writers Martin Delany, Samuel R. Delany, and Octavia Butler; visual artists Wayne Hodge and Rammellzee; musicians Jimi Hendrix, Parliament-Funkadelic, Sun Ra, Juan Atkins, Afrika Bambaataa, 4HERO, Dillinja and Janelle Monae; and filmmakers Hype Williams, Wanuri Kahiu and Ryan Coogan. Both Coogans’s “The Back Panther’ and Kahiu’s short film “Pumzi’ will be required viewings in the course. The main text for the course will be the compendium ‘Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astroblackness’ by Reynaldo Anderson and John Jennings. There will also be a few supporting auxiliary readings.'),
('PHIL 31126','The Human Condition: Meeting Life’s Challenges','This course will examine some of the main challenges that human beings everywhere confront in their lives. Grief, loneliness, disappointment, and the inevitability of death are universal experiences; disability of one sort or another affects everyone as they age and for some is the result of more contingent accident. Philosophical texts, classical and contemporary, will be mined for the insights they provide. Autobiographies, short stories, and movies will add the richness of lived experience to our discussions.'),
('PHIL 31127','Africana Philosophy and Philosophy of Race','Africana Philosophy is a relatively new area of philosophical research that seeks to examine and explore the problems faced by the people of the African diaspora, meaning those who have ancestors from the African continent. (Primarily from Africa, the Caribbean, and both North and South America.) In this course we will be considering the different ways Africana Philosophers sought to address various philosophical problems such as those arising from their struggle against racism, colonization, and the legacy of slavery. We will also pay particular attention to how they conceived of their racialized identity and what impact it may have had on their work. But first we’ll begin by briefly exploring what philosophers refer to as the metaphysics of race. In this section, we’ll try to get a sense of what we mean by race or races. Are races groups of people that share similar physical traits? Or does one’s ancestry determine one''s race? Or are races merely something created by human social or cultural practices—and if so, how? As we know, racial classification is significant, because it can confer negative social and political values onto individuals by using their ‘race’ as a means of regulating their socio-political life and as a rationale for their dehumanization. This will then help us get a better understanding of the issues raised by a people whose humanity has been challenged and called into question.'),
('PHIL 31128','The Ethics of Reproduction','This course surveys central issues in the ethics of human reproduction. Topics include the morality of abortion; whether we can harm people by bringing them into existence; moral issues raised by assisted reproduction; genetic selection and enhancement; the impact of our reproductive choices on future generations. The course will introduce students to philosophical conceptions of personal identity, fundamental moral notions (e.g., harm, interests, autonomy, respect), and the standards of bioethical debate.'),
('PHIL 31129','Eurocentrism and Decolonization in 20th-Century Philosophy','This course will introduce and critically assess the philosophical roots of Eurocentric and Colonial ideology as found in Edmund Husserl''s phenomenological philosophy of history. In writings in the 1920''s and 1930''s, Husserl argued that the scientism and naturalism of Western culture threaten, paradoxically, to undermine the social value of objective truth and human meaning. His solution to this crisis is to renew and disseminate the Western/European conception of philosophy as the intuitive grasp of timeless, objective, and ideal truths, which is associated with a conception of universal human rationality stemming back to ancient Greece. Decolonial philosophers have argued that this picture hides a totalizing dynamic that erases particular difference. We will explore and critically assess some of these Decolonial critiques developed over the course of the 20th-Century. In particular, we will study the critiques of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and the overlooked Beninese philosopher and political activist Paulin Hountondji. We will also relate this debate in phenomenology to programs of Decolonial resistance in Feminist (Audre Lorde, Maria Lugones), Caribbean (Aime Césaire, Frantz Fanon), Native American (Standing Bear, Brian Burkhart), and Palestinian thought (Fayez Sayegh).'),
('PHIL 31130','Philosophy of Perception: Olfaction vs. Vision','In this course we will explore concepts from perceptual philosophy including mental representations, qualia, consciousness, illusions, and perceptual objects as well as the relation of perception to other psychological phenomena such as memory, emotion, and language. The focus in the class will be on two forms of perceiving, seeing and smelling, which are philosophical counterpoints representing conflicting intuitions about what happens when we perceive the world around us. Questions addressed may include: What is the relation between the mental (the smells and colors we experience) and the physical (the odor molecules and electromagnetic radiation we encounter)? Can we have knowledge of other minds, and how -- how can I know whether roses smell and look the same to you as they smell and look to me? Do we get a different picture of the relation between mind and world if we use vision as the paradigmatic sense than if we use olfaction? Most of the readings will be contemporary philosophy but we will also read some relevant contributions from psychology and cognitive science.'),
('PHIL 31131','History of Phil of Mind','The nature of the mind and mental states are hotly debated, in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. Given this ongoing debate, it is fruitful to know how the mind has been understood in earlier times and by different cultures. This course will explore ancient Greek and Roman, medieval European and Arabic, early Modern, and contemporary conceptions of the mind, tracing how these understandings of the mind differ and developed in light of new problems and new putative solutions.'),
('PHIL 31132','Mind, Body, and World: Merleau-Ponty''s Phenomenology of Perception','In this class, we will study the groundbreaking book The Phenomenology of Perception by Merleau-Ponty. This book established Merleau-Ponty as the leading French phenomenologist of his generation. The unifying theme of the Phenomenology is perception, and the experience of the body as the perceptual organ. It argues that the complex way we exist in our bodies connects us to the world and makes us conscious of the world. It explores existential dimensions including sexuality, language, space, nature, intersubjectivity, time, and freedom. It combines ideas from traditional phenomenology?especially from its founder, Edmund Husserl?with developments in cognitive neuroscience, social science, history, literature, art, and politics. Because of these diverse and fascinating themes, it inspires interdisciplinary work across a wide range of disciplines.'),
('PHIL 31134','God and Science','It is difficult to name two arenas of human thought that have shaped civilization as powerfully as have religion and science. Yet they appear to stand in great tension -- if not outright opposition -- with one another: while religion typically involves faith in a divine creator and belief in supernatural phenomena, science purportedly deals in reason alone, describing objective facts about natural phenomena. But are science and belief in God really at odds? Do they say conflicting things about causation, free will, consciousness, morality, the origin of life and the cosmos? What roles do belief, reason, evidence, truth and objectivity play in religious versus scientific worldviews? This class explores such questions through the lens of history (principally in the West, and with respect to monotheistic traditions) and through critical examination of the nature, practices and aims of contemporary scientific and religious thought.'),
('PHIL 31135','Existentialism: Sartre, Beauvoir, Fanon','Existentialism is a widely influential philosophical view. However, perhaps because of its popularity, it is also widely misunderstood, even amongst philosophers. This class aims to counter this misunderstanding by examining the initial development of existentialism in the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, contrasting these with their critical reception by those who rejected the label ?existentialist? (such as Albert Camus and Martin Heidegger). We will chart how existentialism evolved in the writings of its founders, due primarily to Beauvoir?s objections to Sartre?s conception of human freedom. We will also explore how this spurred the development of feminist philosophy. We will conclude the course by using this early history of existentialism as a framework for understanding the philosophy of Frantz Fanon, who applied (and critically revised) existentialism in his analysis of racial oppression, psychiatry, and political activism.'),
('PHIL 31141','Community','Community is often invoked respectfully but without a clear referent. The word is said to be used ninety-four ways, evidence that its sense is diffuse. The class will clarify the word''s principal expressions and the alternative ideological spaces--holistic and hierarchical or open and tolerant--in which communities form. Members bind in the interest of utility--jobs or schools--or because home and friendship are the focus of feeling and significance. These binders are social glue: they explain our dedication to communal aims and loyalty to fellow members. Autonomy in their context is socialized; its bases are the information, attitudes, and skills acquired when families and schools prepare us for roles in communities inherited or chosen. Yet community is fraught. Holistic societies are repressive; open societies are vulnerable. The members of successful communities--families, businesses, and schools--often thrive. Those excluded for want of luck or skill are abandoned and anonymous. Their isolation is one of an open society''s two pathologies: collaboration is a social necessity when resources, space, and skills are scarce; competition turned visceral and murderous is a vice.'),
('PHIL 31142','Plato’s Republic','This course will conduct an intensive reading of Plato''s Republic, and perhaps other works by Plato. The Republic brings the famously impractical subject of philosophy into close engagement with the cynical practicalities of politics. To make that engagement happen, Plato reimagines philosophy so that it can organize politics, but also reimagines politics so that it opens itself up to philosophical intervention. The result is a grand and mysterious dialogue that speaks to politics, ethics, psychology, education, the nature of art, and metaphysics. The course will undertake a sustained and close study of the Republic. Students will keep a journal, write some short response pieces, and construct bibliographies for further research.'),
('PHIL 31170','Pragmatism and Individuality','Addresses themes of individualism and personalism in ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics, with a focus on transcendentalism and pragmatism. Philosophers studied include Edwards, Emerson, James, Peirce, Dewey, and Quine.'),
('PHIL 31171','Philosophy of Perception','This class will focus on a paradox about sensory perception that has long fascinated philosophers. While perception seems to make the physical, mind-independent world immediately available to us, it does this in a way that is irreducibly perspectival, incomplete, and subject to illusion and hallucination. So, it seems, perception promises something that it cannot guarantee: immediate cognitive awareness of the external world. We will learn and critically evaluate the rich array of responses to this paradox by closely studying and critically evaluating (from other philosophical perspectives) an influential text by the late British philosopher A.D. Smith, entitled The Problem of Perception.'),
('PHIL 31172','Philosophy of Imagination','We use imagination in a lot of ways: from empathizing with others, engaging with music and literature, and planning our future to dreaming, art-making or conducting philosophical thought experiments. This course will investigate a variety of questions related to imagination. Does imagination necessarily involve imageries? What is the role of the self when we imagine: are all imaginations essentially imagining ourselves doing something or can imagination purely be directed at an external object? Is dreaming an imaginative state? How does imagination function in art-making, philosophical thought experiments, and scientific discoveries? What are the moral and conceptual constraints on what we are willing or able to imagine? Can we imagine nothingness?'),
('PHIL 31173','Philosophy and Liberation','What does it mean to be liberated? For some, it might mean an end to police repression. For others, simply being able to make decisions about their bodies. Can liberation be achieved through democratic means? Or does liberation demand radical changes to our social world? If so, this might require profound changes to our institutions, how we relate to each other, and even to our sense of self. These are some of the issues we will be exploring in this course. We will first consider the general question of what do we mean by liberation, reviewing how it was conceived in past social movements. We will then examine current theoretical analysis of key issues such as domination and oppression, ideology, social structures, agency, autonomy, and what it means to be in community. We will then be in a position to ask: is liberation even possible? If yes, how so?'),
('PHIL 31177','Philosophy Of Education','This course will serve as an introduction to the fundamental philosophical questions surrounding the nature and aims of education. We will familiarize ourselves with classic texts in philosophy pertaining to education--Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Rousseau, Mill, and Dewey as well as contemporary work in education. We will discuss the nature of learning and teaching, the relationship between education and the values of equality and autonomy, the role of race and class in education, and the ongoing critical debate concerning higher education. Students will be expected to critically reflect on their own educational experiences.'),
('PHIL 31178','Kant''s Critique of Pure Reason"','This course introduces students to the theoretical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, by way of a close reading of Kant’s most famous work, the Critique of Pure Reason. Topics that may be discussed include: Kant’s philosophy of mind; Kant’s philosophy of logic; the relation between experience and concepts; transcendental idealism and the nature of space and time; knowledge of the external world and self-knowledge; reconciling determinism and free will; Kant’s refutation of skepticism; the self and the unity of the thinking subject.'),
('PHIL 31179','Philosophy of Biology','A study of the conceptual issues that stem from various of the biological sciences, with a particular emphasis on evolution and the environment.'),
('PHIL 31180','Philosophy of Psychiatry','The philosophy of psychiatry is an area of inquiry dealing with topics at the intersection of philosophy and the study of mental illness. Accordingly, students in this course will engage with questions like: What is the difference between healthy and dysfunctional psychological traits, behaviors, and emotions? Is this a medical or philosophical concept? Are psychiatric illnesses disorders of the mind or the brain? Do social and political values influence our determination that someone is psychologically abnormal? If so, what are the implications that follow from this for psychiatric categories like “depression” and “schizophrenia” that claim to track objective, scientifically “real” disorders? How have our concepts of “madness” and “insanity” shifted over time, and what explains these changes?'),
('PHIL 31181','Philosophy of Literature','Questions of the relationship between literature and truth go back as far as Plato, and are still debated. Could the issue of artistic truth be formulated in terms of whether a person learns through experiencing a work of literature? Are the emotions a reader feels from a work of literature true emotions, and if so, how are they created from mere words on a page? Is engagement with literature valuable for its own sake, or only if that engagement involves the reader in moral, religious or political causes? How does literature trigger aesthetic experience and engage the reader? Is the effect of a work of literature purely a product of the author''s intentions, or is it conditioned on the reader’s interpretation and emotional responses, or the formal and semiotic properties of literary works? What is the relationship between philosophy and literature? To answer that we will examine not only philosophy of literature, but philosophy in literature.'),
('PHIL 31182','History of Philosophy of Mind','History of Philosophy of Mind'),
('PHIL 31183','Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Science','The course will investigate questions in philosophy of mind that can benefit from both empirical evidence and rigorous philosophical analysis. We’ll explore questions such as: What are concepts and how do we acquire them? Is there innate knowledge? Is there a joint in nature between perception and cognition? Can consciousness be explained? What’s the difference between non-human animals'' cognition and ours? We’ll also engage with methodological questions such as: What’s the role of intuition in philosophical studies of the mind? How does empirical evidence bear on philosophical debates?'),
('PHIL 31184','Black Mirror and Philosophy','Black Mirror is an Emmy-winning series that holds up a dark, digital mirror of speculative technologies to modern society, showing us a high-tech world where it is all too easy to fall victim to ever-evolving forms of social control. The course will explore the many philosophical aspects of selected Black Mirror episodes.'),
('PHIL 31185','Moral Psychology','This course deals with a number of issues in moral philosophy that make assumptions about human psychology, so they warrant a closer look at what empirical psychology tells us about the capacities that human beings actually have. Various topics at the intersection of ethics, psychology, and philosophy of mind will be examined, including moral motivation, moral reasoning, moral responsibility, and moral character. Among the psychologists to be considered are Jean Piaget, Lawrence Kohlberg, Carol Gilligan and more recently, Jonathan Haidt and Joshua Greene. The philosophers to be examined include John Doris, Joshua Knobe, Shaun Nichols, and Thomas Nagel.'),
('PHIL 31186','Philosophy of Simone Weil','Philosopher Simone Weil (1909-1943) has been called ''the patron saint of outsiders.'' Her short life appears paradoxical: Weil was a student of France''s elite educational system at a time when few women pursued a degree in philosophy; a fierce activist on behalf of the working class and against colonialism; an independent person who ignored gender convention; a brilliant reader of Plato, Buddhism, Kant, and the Egyptian Book of the Dead; a mystic and unorthodox Catholic of Jewish background who refused baptism. In this course, we venture beyond Weil''s legend; we aim to study Weil''s writings on politics, science, literature, philosophy and religion, with an eye towards their (asystematic) unity. Throughout our reading, we hold ourselves open to the beautiful and the good, to which Weil guides our attention, during this, our own extraordinary time -- a time in which, as Weil wrote in the 1940s, ''affliction is hanging over us all.'''),
('PHIL 31187','Latin American Philosophy','This course will focus on selected philosophical topics in Latin American Philosophy from both past and contemporary sources. Topics include identity, race, political philosophy, feminism, and the colonial and decolonial turn. We will pursue answers to questions such as "What does Latino/Latina/Latinx mean?", "How significant is race to Latin American philosophical debate?", "Is there a unique Latin American feminism? If so, what are its distinctive features?", "What is the colonial matrix of power, and how is it used to characterize political matters?" Readings include texts by Las Casas, Simon Bolívar, María Lugones, Domingo Sarmiento, Linda Martín Alcoff, José Vasconcelos, Lélia Gonzalez, Paulo Freire, Walter Mignolo, among others.'),
('PHIL 31188','African-American Philosophy','This course will engage a number of central concepts, themes, and figures within the distinctive and flourishing field of African-American Philosophy. African-American Philosophy as a subfield of a broader Africana Philosophical tradition has particular concerns with issues such as self-determination and self-knowledge, oppression, freedom, liberation, violence, ethnic or racial identity, the nature of persons, social ontology, justice, Afrofuturism, Afro-Pessimism and the critical theory of race. Also, as with any type of philosophical thinking and debate, African-American Philosophy may make claims of a general, universal scope. Students will develop an appreciation of the unique philosophical voices in the Black/Africana/Aboriginal intellectual tradition. The course will further focus on contemporary issues in the U.S. centering on structural and interpersonal racism and Black and/or African-American Aesthetics. We will engage these from a distinctly African-American orientation including at times from militant revolutionary political-philosophical points of view. Authors include: Martin Delaney, Frederick Douglass, Anna Julia, Cooper, Sojourner Truth, W.E.B. DuBois, Marcus Garvey, Alain Locke, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X (Shabazz), Kwame Touré, Black Panther Intellectuals, Michelle Moody-Adams, Howard McGary, Charles Mills, Harvey Cormier, Tommie Shelby and Tommy Currie, among others'),
('PHIL 31189','Philosophy of Sport','People have played sports in some fashion since pre-historic times. Sport is fundamental to so many aspects of our lives, whether we are active participants, coaches, fans, occasional on lookers, or distant observers. This course will serve as an introduction to and a comprehensive overview of a variety of philosophical issues at the heart of sport. We will start by asking, what is sport? How is sport different than mere play? We will examine ethical issues in sport (i.e. cheating, fair play, sportsmanship), sport as a locus of character development, aesthetics of sport, political dimensions of sport, athlete activism, disability in sport, sex classification in sport, and issues of race related to sport. Not only will philosophy teach us something about sport, but sport will teach us something about philosophy. Readings will be drawn from both ancient and modern philosophical texts. Film will also be incorporated throughout the course.'),
('PHIL 31190','Problems in Applied and Social Epistemology','A broad introduction to epistemology (traditional, formal, social) with a focus on topics like judgment aggregation, testimony, disagreement, conspiracy theories and misinformation.'),
('PHIL 31191','Philosophical Skepticism','This course will provide a careful study the ideas and arguments of some of the most influential philosophers in the history of philosophical skepticism about knowledge in the Western tradition and some of the most influential responses to them. The major forms of skepticism in this tradition and the responses to them—including ancient Academic and Pyrrhonian skepticism as well as modern Cartesian and Kantian conceptions of skeptical challenges—will be carefully studied both in their respective historical contexts and in their reception in contemporary philosophical literature. The course will cover classical texts by Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Cicero, Montaigne, Descartes, Hume, Berkeley and Kant, as well as a variety of recent texts by contemporary figures in epistemology.'),
('PHIL 31192','Life Lessons from Dead Philosophers','What can we learn from dead white (and non-white) men (and women)? A lot, if pick the right ones and if we pay attention. This course will examine what some of the best philosophers of the past still have to teach us today, including Socrates, Marcus Aurelius, Simone Veil, Gandhi, Confucius, Simone de Beauvoir, and several others. Let''s embark together in a life-changing pursuit of wisdom and discovery as we attempt to find answers to our most vital questions.'),
('PHIL 31193','Kant on the Foundations of Human Rights','The philosophy of Immanuel Kant is crucial to contemporary debates about human rights. This course will introduce students to Kant’s theory of human rights, along with key aspects of his broader philosophy necessary to understand it, including his ethical theory, metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of law. We will discuss questions like the following. Do human rights exist only when there is a political consensus supporting them, or do they have a metaphysical or moral foundation which transcends politics? What kind of free will do we require to have human rights? When is it just to harm other people who violate our human rights? What does it mean to respect the human rights of criminals? Readings will include a selection of Kant’s original texts and contemporary philosophy in the Kantian tradition.'),
('PHIL 31194','Philosophy of Conspiracy Theory','This course uses the idea of conspiracy theories to explore basic issues in the theory of knowledge. Typically we think that theories are more likely to be true when they provide unifying explanations—that is, when they explain a wide variety of phenomena as the result of one cause, or law, or other explanatory principle. Reasonable people understand that theories which invoke conspiracies are likely to be false. But conspiracy theories typically provide unifying explanations. Further, there is often no obvious evidence against conspiracy theories. So why are they likely to be false? This class will include contemporary and/or historical philosophical readings, and may include topics such as belief revision and logic, skepticism, topics in philosophy of science such as confirmation and explanation, and topics in cognitive science such as cognitive bias and fallacy.'),
('PHIL 31195','Consciousness','Explaining consciousness has been and continues to be one of the hot button issues in both philosophy and cognitive science in the last half century. This course introduces students to some of the core issues in the philosophy of consciousness, surveys a number of the scientifically and philosophically informed theories of consciousness, and investigates the scientific experiments that attempt to answer questions about what consciousness is, and what we are conscious of. Students of all levels of familiarity with issues of consciousness are invited to register'),
('PHIL 31196','Structural Injustice','In this course we will investigate structural forms of injustice that emerge from the actions of groups of individuals without their conscious intention or organization. The course is split into three parts. First, we will explore a variety of philosophical perspectives on the social ontology and ethical implications of structural injustice. Second, we will consider specific forms of structural injustice, including inequality, oppression, domination, exploitation, and alienation. Finally, we will apply these theories to analyze contemporary social structures, including race, sex, ability, and capitalism.'),
('PHIL 31197','The Mind/Body Problem','How are the mind and the body related? Is the mind identical to the brain, a brain process, something more abstract, something non-physical? How would we know? To ask and attempt to answer these questions is to engage with the mind-body problem. In this course, we explore the metaphysical theories of mind that offer distinct answers to the mind-body problem (e.g. dualism, behaviorism, functionalism, etc.). Additionally, we discuss the practical and epistemological consequences of those views when it comes to knowing our own minds, knowing the minds of others, etc. Students of all levels of familiarity with issues in philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and epistemology are invited to register.'),
('PHIL 31198','Philosophy of Virtual Reality','Is virtual reality genuine reality, or are virtual “worlds” second-class worlds that are not as real as everyday life? Can we live meaningful lives in virtual reality, or is virtual life just an effort to escape everyday life? What would it mean to live ethically in virtual reality? Can we be sure we’re not living in a virtual world already? If we are, then who designed it? Should we think about the designer as a being like a traditional God? We will examine questions like these in the context of a close reading of David Chalmers’ groundbreaking book Reality+: Virtual Worlds and the Problems of Philosophy.'),
('PHIL 31199','Metaphysics and Ethics of Mental Disorders','Mental disorders raise important issues in many areas of philosophy, including the nature of consciousness, free will, moral responsibility, and social and political philosophy. But, what are mental disorders? Are they the result of an underlying neurological condition? Or do mental disorders arise from a failure of the individual to adapt to their environment? How do we know if someone is suffering from a mental disorder? What are the signs? Should how we treat someone with a mental disorder depend on whether or not we believe the underlying condition is neurological or social? How do we distinguish between these two root causes? These are some of the issues we will be exploring in this course. We will first consider the general question of what constitutes a mental disorder, reviewing phenomenological, neurological, social constructionist, dysfunction and distress accounts We will, then, examine current theoretical analysis of mental disorders such as depression/mania, schizophrenia, addiction, dissociative disorders, autism, and psychopathy. We will, also, investigate the DSM and the methods used therein to distinguish between disorders, paying careful attention to any cultural and historical distinctions in philosophical theories of diagnosis and treatment.'),
('PHIL 31200','Witchcraft, Religion and Magic','Witchcraft, Religion and Magic'),
('PHIL 31201','Selected topics in Metaphysics','Selected topics in metaphysics, the study of fundamental issues about the nature of reality, including consciousness, mind and matter, time and eternity, and many more.  Repeatable for credit up to 10 times.  Students will not get credit for topics previously taken under a different course number.'),

('PSY B9904','Decolonizing Mental Health','Decolonization is the process of deconstructing colonial ideologies of the superiority and privilege of Western (White Patriarchal) thought and approaches. While decolonization is generally considered in reference to geo-political systemic structures, its applicability to mental health service delivery is of critical import to psychology. Colonization perpetuates the status quo, maintaining power dominance of a White, Patriarchal, Racist, Homophobic hierarchy. Western mental health and social service methodologies serve to perpetuate colonization, justifying the dominance of a White, Patriarchal systemic structure. This course will serve to examine the systemic implication of a mental health service delivery that ''blames the victim'', and perpetuates an oppressive systemic culture that deleteriously impacts the lives of women, immigrants, folk of color, LGBTQ folk, etc. Western mental health focuses on pathology, branding traumatized and oppressed folk as ''ill'', mentally unbalanced, paranoid, ''out of control'', etc. Decolonizing mental health service delivery enables the psychology student to focus on a Strength Based approach, that emphasizes ''positives'', and, employs a non-directive, empowering therapeutic stance. The psychologist/therapist is neither god, nor more powerful all-knowing. Rather, a decolonizing mental health approach emphasizes the partnership of therapist and patient. The therapist listens, shares, participates in full partnership with his/her patient. Illuminating this course will be the writings and clinical practice of Frantz Fanon, an Afro-French psychiatrist and 1960''s spokesperson of the successful Algerian Revolution against French colonial oppression. Finally, the empowerment process inherent in therapeutic healing, is embedded within an understanding of context and trauma. Oppressed folk reflect rage, resistance, as well as internalization of said oppression, resulting in self-destructive behavior. Enabling such folk to see, feel, and comprehend their oppression is a critical first step in healing.'),

('PSY 31191','Decolonizing Mental Health','Decolonization is the process of deconstructing colonial ideologies of the superiority and privilege of Western (White Patriarchal) thought and approaches. While decolonization is generally considered in reference to geo-political systemic structures, its applicability to mental health service delivery is of critical import to psychology. Colonization perpetuates the status quo, maintaining power dominance of a White, Patriarchal, Racist, Homophobic hierarchy. Western mental health and social service methodologies serve to perpetuate colonization, justifying the dominance of a White, Patriarchal systemic structure. This course will serve to examine the systemic implication of a mental health service delivery that ‘blames the victim’, and perpetuates an oppressive systemic culture that deleteriously impacts the lives of women, immigrants, folk of color, LGBTQ folk, etc. Western mental health focuses on pathology, branding traumatized and oppressed folk as ‘ill’, mentally unbalanced, paranoid, ‘out of control’, etc. Decolonizing mental health service delivery enables the psychology student to focus on a Strength Based approach, that emphasizes ‘positives’, and, employs a non-directive, empowering therapeutic stance. The psychologist/therapist is neither god, nor more powerful all-knowing. Rather, a decolonizing mental health approach emphasizes the partnership of therapist and patient. The therapist listens, shares, participates in full partnership with his/her patient. Illuminating this course will be the writings and clinical practice of Frantz Fanon, an Afro-French psychiatrist and 1960’s spokesperson of the successful Algerian Revolution against French colonial oppression. Finally, the empowerment process inherent in therapeutic healing, is embedded within an understanding of context and trauma. Oppressed folk reflect rage, resistance, as well as internalization of said oppression, resulting in self-destructive behavior. Enabling such folk to see, feel, and comprehend their oppression is a critical first step in healing.'),

('PSY 31195','Sociology of Mental Health','This course investigates the complex social and cultural processes that shape our experiences and meanings of mental health.

This course examines the structures, processes and interactions that make up contemporary globalization in the economy, politics, culture, media, social movements and civil society, migration, and the environment. It considers debates about the historical emergence of globalization and its causes and consequences in everyday life.'),
('SOC 31142','Latino Youths in Schools: Barriers & Breakthroughs','Latino students now comprise one out of every four public school students. As this group becomes an increasingly larger proportion of the US student population, understanding their position in the educational system and responding to their unique needs is not only important for other Latinos, but for the nation as a whole.  This course is therefore designed for undergraduate students who are interested in doing direct practice or research with diverse populations, particularly Latinos in urban school contexts. Using perspectives from the Sociology of Education, History of Education, and Urban Education, we will explore how immigration status, assimilation and acculturation, language, gender, race/phenotype, and socio-economic background, all influence the experience of Latinos in the US school system.'),
('SOC 31143','Immigration','Migration is one of the most relevant topics for contemporary social sciences. This course will explore the most influential works on migration, focusing on the United States'' experience of migration since the 1960s.'),
('SOC 31144','Blancas, Negras Y Morenas: Race in Another America','This course explores the historical and contemporary factors that affect the construction and of an ethnic or racial identity among Latin American immigrants and their youth in the US. Drawing on history, sociology and literary fiction on the social construction of race and ethnic identities, students learn about the challenges of living in a host society which uses a very different racial schema than those used in the nation of origin. Questions and themes guiding this course include: why are race, ethnicity and gender important categories in the construction of a minority or majority identity? Why are skin color and phenotype so important predictors of social mobility in Latin America and the US? What is the role of the government or that of the Census in the construction, erosion or diffusion of racial identies and boundaries? How may the history of Latin America imperialism, colonization, mestizaje, indigenismo, and modernization help us better capture the social construction of race and its key role in determining majority and minority relations and intergenerational inequality.'),
('SOC 31145','Racialization: Single Mothers, Sexual and Religious Minorities','This course offers an introduction to the study of minority and majority group relations in the United States with a comparative focus drawing from examples in Latin America and Europe. We examine the historical factors that have led to the creation of a white majority and a black minority in America and other national contexts; how a minority or majority status is created and internalized by individuals and their youth. We pay close attention to how increasing economic and wealth inequality, globalization and immigration affects the formation of new, minority groups and statuses drawing on the example of growing share of working poor or ''missing class'' individuals in America; the life chances of the undocumented, and those of single migrant mothers, religious minorities such as Muslim youth and the networks of sexual minorities that help them integrate in society and cope with glaring discrimination and exclusion. Students will be able to engage in informed debates about how increases in family, ethnic, racial and sexual diversity in the US and other nations will help close the historical divides between white and black groups in America. They will also master new knowledge on how race and racialization processes take place in Latin America or in nations such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic where efforts have been made to alleviate racial inequality and tensions, but where blacks and mulattoes have historically make up the majority of the poor and whites and light-skin people still make up the ruling elite.'),
('SOC 31146','Social Psychology Racism Prejudice','Migration Disrupts familiar rules of living and leads to conflicts of culture. This course will review developmental psychology theory and discuss psychological disruptions experienced by immigrants in relation to their individual developmental stages. We also will examine disruptions specific to particular ethnic groups. The course will discuss the psychological vulnerabilities as well as resiliencies that result from the process of immigrant acculturation. Throughout the course we will seek to discern preventive measures that could lessen negative outcomes and promote positive outcomes through effective decision making in response to disruptions of migration.'),
('SOC 31147','NORMAL ACCIDENTS: SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MODERN DISASTER','In today''s world, the wide spread diffusion of high risk technologies interact with weak regulation, institutional corruption, psycho-social dynamics and chance events to render catastrophic accidents normal. Through case studies of disasters and readings in organizational behavior, this course explores the sociological elements underlying human-made catastrophes. Case studies will include airplane and maritime disasters, nuclear power plant accidents, contamination of water and food supplies.'),
('SOC 31148','NORMAL ACCIDENTS: SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES ON MODERN DISASTER','In today''s world, the wide spread diffusion of high risk technologies interact with weak regulation, institutional corruption, psycho-social dynamics and chance events to render catastrophic accidents normal. Through case studies of disasters and sociological literature on organizational behavior, this course will explore the sociological elements underlying human-made catastrophes, including airplane and maritime disasters, nuclear power plant meltdowns, large scale contamination of water and food supplies.'),
('SOC 31149','Contemporary Asian American Experiences','The main objective of this course is to provide an overview of Asian-American experiences by covering Asian Americans both as a whole with regard to particular topics and major Asian ethnic groups separately. Major Asian American groups to be covered separately are Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, South Asian, Korean, and Indo-Chinese (Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians). General topics to be covered are immigration (history and contemporary trends), settlement patterns, socio-economic adjustment, prejudice and discrimination experienced, family and gender issues, community organization, ethnicity (ethnic attachment, ethnic identity, and ethnic solidarity), religious background, and intergenerational transition.'),

('SOC 31152','Immigration and the Second Generation','The second generation, native-born of foreign parentage, is often caught between two distinctive worlds of their immigrant parents and American society. The study of the second generation is a cutting-edge topic in the fields of immigration and ethnic and racial studies as they are making the transition from school to work. The course examines the ways in which children of immigrants are integrating into different US institutions, such as education, economy, politics, as well as American culture. A key concern is to examine existing theories of assimilation in terms of the similarities and differences between the old (turn of the 20th century) and new (post-1965) second generation. Another important issue is whether the children of immigrants are doing better than their parents educationally and occupationally, given the structural changes in American economy and society. In light of the current political debate about immigration policy, which directly affects the children of undocumented immigrants, the course will also cover this often overlooked group. Although the course will deal with the United States as a whole, the experience of children of immigrants who have grown up in New York will also be highlighted.'),
('SOC 31153','Migration, Gender and Health in Latinx Communities','Through an interdisciplinary feminist approach, this course explores how women, men, and youth experience health problems related to migration and social inequality. We will place health risks within a transnational context, examining the socio-economic, political, and cultural influences on particular social problems and health outcomes and critique the political discourse on health and how they construct racialized, sexualized others. We examine health promotion and other programs that aim to design culturally sensitive interventions about health problems by migrants and how communities and individuals work toward alleviating their own health risks. Some familiarity with Spanish is helpful.'),
('SOC 31156','Journalism and Society: Covering Power','This course if part of the NBCU Academy Fellows Program. Journalism is often called the fourth estate, which describes the media’s role as a watchdog of power, both public and private.

Students will explore and learn how to analyze data to uncover insights, trends and narratives buried in the numbers'),
('SOC 31157','Self and Society: Anxiety and the Social Self','How do social performance and social groups provoke, shape, and structure our experience of anxiety? How does anxiety and its management shape our self-understanding as social agents? Has the experience of anxiety changed in relation to changing social conditions? We will explore how anxiety has been defined in clinical terms and contrast contemporary diagnoses with other ways it has been understood historically. We will explore anxiety from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including existentialism, psychoanalysis, and classical social theory. We will also explore contemporary social anxiety in relation to COVID-19, ecological catastrophe, performance on social media, and social class.'),

('SOC 31166','Illness Narratives and Patient Experiences','What is illness? How do patients articulate discomfort, pain, and suffering? How do patients turn these at times idiosyncratic complaints into a coherent narrative that resonates with other patients suffering from similar conditions? Who listens to these narratives, and are these experiences taken seriously? This course examines the process of healing, living with chronic illness, and dying through stories and voices from patients. While the individual experiences of patients matter, this course also examines how broader social structures come to shape accounts of health and illness.'),

('SOC 31171','Sustainability, Diversity & Inclusion: Visions, Realities & Praxes for an Enduring & Just Soc World','Immersing ourselves in New York’s rich urban ecology with on-site visits, we address the social movements of "sustainability" and "inclusion" with a focus on their respective claims regarding "(bio)diversity" as essential to a healthy planet and a modern equitable society. We explore these claims in the context of our contemporary geopolitics and political economy where difference is, to the contrary, often characterized by inequality. At this impasse of social vision and social reality, we examine the complex relationship between the appropriation and destruction of the material world; the changing ideas and increasing stratification in the social world; and, the contemporary systems of production that appropriate life and consciousness in the global information economy of late high modernity.'),
('SOC 31172','Nationalism and National Questions','This course aims to provide a multi-dimension approach to the issues of the nation-state, nationalism, and national independence movements.

We will also examine the linguistic, cultural, racial, religious, or territorial aspects of nationalist struggles.'),
('SOC 31173','Seductions of Crime','Jack Katz’s groundbreaking book, “Seductions of Crime: Moral and Sensual Attractions in Doing Evil,” challenges conventional criminology by exploring the sensual nature of the criminal act. He walks the reader through an in-depth explanation of various criminal acts, explores the lifestyle of the criminal, and the thought processes and emotions the perpetrator feels in those precious moments before and after they committed the crime, be it spousal murder, shoplifting, robbery and violence, or senseless murder. This course is a deep reading of “Seduction of Crime” allowing students to reflect on important sociological themes, innovative methods, and often counter-intuitive conclusions.'),
('SOC 31174','Ethnography of Latinx Youth and Justice','What is social justice? What does social justice (and injustice) mean in the context of a diverse, global city like New York?

How could these systems be re-imagined through Black Feminist Abolitionist movements so that they serve stakeholders? This course centers the voices of those ensnared in carceral systems and explores key conceptual frameworks, practices, and genealogies of abolition, especially in relation to Black and queer feminisms. This course delves into the relationship between dismantling prisons and other carceral systems, including, but not limited to, family regulation, immigration, capitalism, schools, psychiatry, and gender and family norms. In critiquing Social Work practice within progressive change movements and exploring Abolitionist Social Work, the course creates space for freedom dreaming and radical reimagining of our communities without oppressive and harmful systems.'),
('SOC 31190','Social Justice and Latinx Communities','What is social justice? What does social justice (and injustice) mean in the context of a diverse, global city like New York?

This course examines dynamic forms of social life from cultural, economic, political, and psychological perspectives.  These conceptions of time include Durkheim''s distinction of sacred and profane time, Marx''s conception of commodity as externalized/dead labor time, and Virilio''s correlation between military and cinematic perception of movement to mutually reinforcing fluidity of social identities and data.  We will see how sociology can bring together these multifaceted aspects of social production and time, speed and historicity. '),

('SOC 31197','Cults, Authoritarian and New Religious Movements: Charisma and Domination','Why do people join cults? Why are authoritarian leaders so compelling to so many people? How do "charismatic" leaders and collectives convince members to give up control over their lives, including their finances and intimate relationships? This course explores popular, self-help, religious, and political movements through the lenses of sociological and psychological theories. Working from specific case studies, we examine research on cults and authoritarian movements, and develop theoretical frameworks that will help us to understand the personal, structural, and emotional factors that draw people to such movements.

This course simultaneously deconstructs and reconstructs our understanding of love and relationships — from romantic, to platonic, to familial, to sexual, and other intimate connections — using a sociological lens. We explore themes ranging from what love is and what love should be, to how normative and non-normative relationship structures (e.g. monoamory, polyamory, relationship anarchy, etc.) have changed, to what kinds of relationships (e.g. romantic partnership, friendship, situationships, marriage, chosen family, etc.) institutions recognize and support.'),

Emphasizing ethnographic approaches, but also drawing on a variety of interdisciplinary sources we examine how racial formations, gender and national belonging have historically and in recent times intersected in the production and representation of Latinidad. More specifically, we will examine how people summon the concept of Latinidad in order to form a unifying collective identity as a political strategy, but also how such projects have the potential to erase other forms of identification or kinds of experiences. Through a close reading of scholarly and popular texts we will engage with themes including transnationalism and migration, social inequality and practices of resistance, gender and sexuality, language, belonging and media representation.'),

('SUS 8601B','Technological and business innovation in distributed and low-carbon energy system','Driven by the urgent need to mitigate climate change and improve energy resiliency, the energy sector has undergone significant and far-reaching transformations, including the widespread adoption of renewable energy and the electrification of transportation, cooking, and heating. To support the integration of solar and wind power, various energy storage technologies are being rapidly developed and are becoming more affordable and competitive. Furthermore, the power grid is becoming increasingly decentralized, liberalized, and digitalized, with microgrids becoming a reality. In addition, sensors and smart meters are being widely installed, making the grid "smarter" and allowing for more sophisticated demand-side management programs to be offered. Consumers are no longer solely paying for electricity consumption but are now able to generate electricity and provide services to the grid, such as load shifting and storage in electric vehicle batteries. The decentralization, digitization, and liberalization have allowed many new actors from the private and public sectors to enter the market, making local communities and municipalities significant players in managing energy production and consumption.

Approaching work ranging from South Asian Hijra performances to contemporary Indigenous Two-Spirit plays in North America, this course takes an intersectional, decolonial approach to queer theatre and performance studies. Throughout the semester, we will explore questions such as: what are some definitions and genealogies of queer theatre and performance?

('THTR 31162','Staging Identity: Introduction to Hebrew and Arabic Theater','The course traces the history of theatre in Israel from its beginnings in Eastern and Central Europe in the early years of the twentieth century, through its development in pre-state Palestine and the early decades of Israel (1950s-60s), to the present. The thesis of the course is that theatre in Israel—both Hebrew and Arabic—is “political” theatre; almost all the drama written and produced over the past 120 years is a sharp comment on what is going on the society—politics, religion, societal fault-lines (Palestinian Arabs, Jews from Arab lands, Western- and Eastern-European Jews, native-born Israelis), the Holocaust, the army and the wars, the Arab-Israeli conflict, Zionism—indeed, identity itself. Theatre is the prism through which Israeli society is refracted. We begin with “foundational” plays of the early twentieth century, in the context of the social and political dynamics of that era, which influenced the development of the history of Israeli theatre; thence, representative plays from different periods, examining each in terms of the internal literary dynamics of the drama, and in terms of the political, historical, and societal dynamics of the period in which the play was written and produced. Both primary and secondary literature are examined in the course. Students will read several representative plays in English translation. We survey the history of the development of theatre companies in the Yishuv (the pre-State Jewish community in Palestine) and in Israel, both Hebrew and Arabic. Finally, the course examines the activities of the mainstream theatres in Israel, satirical theatre, and the crucial role played by the “Fringe”—avant-garde and experimental companies. The student will dissect Israeli theatre both as works of literary drama and as theatrical works responding to societal issues in Israel and Palestine.'),

The output of this investigative seminar will be a book made of graphic novels. This seminar will investigate the ways how urban design traverses ideologies of power that are autocratic, authoritarian and dictatorial. This seminar is an invitation to analyze urbanism and its powers by looking at dictatorial commissions, their typology, and their stylistic trappings. On the surface these trappings usually include careful design of temporary urban space such as parades, salutes, group photographs, national currencies and stamps, formal and informal busts, and other memorabilia. These ideological trappings are manifested in ultimate desires to build iconic urban design and eternal city. The seminar will investigate stories about urban design that find elastic ways around ideologies of global political power that are already susceptible to it’s own outside; such as for example China’s ideology of “One Country, Two Systems” and more recently Xi Jinping’s policy of “No More Weird Architecture”. What is then, and what can be the strategy of urbanism when traversing differences of geo-politics, dictatorships and new social systems? What are urbanist strategies of remaining independent and spatially innovative? With this accumulated knowledge we will investigate elements and effects of autocratic power produced and solidified as space, urban, artistic or infrastructural.

We are all too familiar with this perfunctory and ostensibly benign request: in airports and bars, in banks and post offices, at school or in the street, we are routinely asked to confirm that we are who we are, and that we belong there. The injunction to produce identification is but one of the many practices of control that condition modern life, i.e., life in a society haunted by the question of security and increasingly defined by ubiquitous apparatuses of surveillance. This seminar investigates in both historical and theoretical terms the spaces and technologies of such society. In exploring modern society''s practices of control and its big-brotherish arsenal of surveillance technologies (closed-circuit cameras, remote sensors, face-recognition devices, global- positioning systems, data-gathering software and the like), we will look in particular at the ways in which the modern paradigm of security is transforming the spaces around us, from the domestic realm of the house to the public arena of the city. The seminar is ultimately a critical investigation of the impact that surveillance technologies and the paradigm of security have on architecture, urban space, and the very fabric of everyday life.'),

After an introductory lecture on the scope and methods of urban history and two sessions devoted to the principles underpinning the ancient and the medieval city, the course will explore the transformations of urban form and urban life of the past five centuries, with a particular emphasis on the way architects, planners, and urban thinkers have responded to the challenges of urbanization. In order to develop a critical understanding of the economic, social, cultural, and political process that have shaped the European city, we will read from a broad range of sources, including classic works of urban history such as Lewis Mumford''s The City in History and Spiro Kostof''s The City Shaped as well as contributions by geographers, sociologists, cultural historians, and critical theorists.

Students will critically engage with this academic and policy literature and think through how as geographers, architects and urban planners we can utilize our skills to address and understand urban violence and conflict. Specifically, students will through a detailed case study of their choosing show how urban perspectives are critical to the global agenda of sustaining peace.'),

This is an invitation to analyze urbanism and its design powers by looking at dictatorial commissions, their typology, and their stylistic trappings.

The seminar will investigate stories about urban design that find elastic ways around ideologies of global political power that are already susceptible to it’s own outside; such as for example China’s ideology of “One Country, Two Systems” and more recently Xi Jinping’s policy of “No More Weird Architecture”. What is then, and what can be the strategy of urbanism when traversing differences of geo-politics, dictatorships and new social systems?

('UD 62000','New York Urban Expeditions','This course is a workshop-type seminar that provides a critical and practical frame for the analyses and representation of the Urban Environment. It will explore current methods of urban representation as means to understand and analyze the city and, ultimately, to develop generative tools that will allow students to address and incorporate the urban scale to their design projects. By putting these methods of representation into perspective, the course will argue that many of these techniques, in fact, are timeless and universal, but oftentimes they are specific to the time when they were popularized, and relate to the building production and ideas that they represent. The topics are approached through a series of different techniques, resource databases, and software programs. The course takes New York as the testing ground for reading and analyzing the urban fabric. Lectures, readings and site visits will allow the student to familiarize with the subject. Using New York as a Laboratory, and taking as a base the ‘Geographical Expeditions’ a pedagogical methodology developed during the 1960s and 1970s by Radical Geographers (such as William Bunge) that explored ways in which planners would go back to field work and to produce maps and research documents of their urban environment by surveying local communities’ claims for social justice, students will produce a series of analytical documents, working first in groups with a large area (Cluster) of Upper Manhattan, moving then to individual work analyzing a specific site within their assigned area. Weekly assignments consist of the step-by-step completion of a three-parts assignment: Layering the City / Recording the City / Proposing the City. The work will be presented weekly to the course Professor. Students will work on a series of Layered Drawings, in groups, a 2-minutes video of their site, and a free format Site Report, individually. The class will be supported by a series of lectures on the topics, to be held at the beginning and half-way through each of the three-parts, and required readings to be discussed interspersed with the lectures, with content that will give students a critical approach to urban theories and models, and provide guidance and examples to work on their assignments.'),

('UD 62010','Cities and Globalization','As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, our understandings of the city are changing rapidly. Cities come in all different sizes - small, medium, large and mega. Each scale presents different issues and provides different interfaces to global flows of finance, technology, media, migrants and ideas. The concept of the city, which has long provided an orientation to urban space, politics, economy and imagination is increasingly inadequate to capturing the scalar differences unleashed by processes of globalization and the intensification of urbanization across different national territories. This course examines the dominant ideologies of urban form, culture and socio-political difference associated with each urban scale. Planetary urbanism, informality, techno-utopian views embedded in discourses of ‘smart’/resilient cities and emerging conversations around conflict as inspiration for urban change are some of the dominant frameworks within which globalization and urbanization intersect. We will follow each of these frameworks and their implications for understanding contemporary urbanization. With a special focus on the anthropology of the city, we will aim to discover the common infrastructures that link cities as different from each other as New York, Kinshasa, Rio de Janeiro and Mumbai as well as developing strategies for understanding how history, culture and politics introduce difference into the world of cities. If globalization is fundamentally about creating networks and enabling flows, how can we surmount the forces that constantly block some flows and enable others? Based on these understandings, we will discuss and critique models of urban design, design briefs followed to execute urban plans and their underlying tools for adaptation. Our goal is to create a new kind of design brief, one that is based on a careful understanding of different scales of change and that has the potential to engender a city that is hospitable to different kinds of flows, to difference itself, a place where agonism and opposition - between social and cultural others, between haves and have-nots, between humans and nonhumans - can be channeled creatively.'),

The #SayHerName campaign exemplifies this shift, offering a platform for voices often marginalized by mainstream media. This course examines how Black women in the US, impacted by the intersection of patriarchal misogyny and anti-Black racism, face both hypervisibility and invisibility. Their experiences with public safety are often ignored, complicating discussions about state-sanctioned violence and their protection. We will explore how narratives around gender and race shape public safety perceptions and policies. Through videos, readings, podcasts, guest speakers, and discussions, this course investigates the role of narrative power and rhetoric in shaping the experiences and advocacy for the safety and freedom of Black women and girls. We''ll analyze how these narratives impact their rights and the broader fight for their well-being and self-determination.'),

('WS 24563','Women''s Lives in Global Crisis','This course will examine the roles women are expected to embody during times of societal stress and conflict versus the actual roles they inhabit. This exploration will be enhanced by the course?s multimedia approach which allows us to see the shared commonalities and threads of resistance and affirmation that occur across political, cultural, and global spheres. Poetry, plays, novels, and memoir will be used alongside peer reviewed articles, historical accounts, and both documentary and narrative film. Global Crisis is defined, for this course, as violence - both traditional state waged war and communal conflict, migration - forced and ?voluntary?, environmental crisis, genocide, human rights violations, and political repression/upheaval/etc. Women often simultaneously embody roles of resistance to and in support of societal needs, forging new identities along the way. The study of what appears to be a contradiction leads to a more nuanced understanding of the intersection of power and the lived realities of women. This exploration affords an opportunity to expand ideas around what it means to be a woman living in times of crisis. Importantly, it demands we address what the larger societal implications and benefits are when we consider women?s voices in working to address and remedy crisis and conflict.'),
('WS 24659','Anthropology of Gender & Sexuality','This course explores how gender and secuality are iterated, performed, challenged, and managed. Instead of seeing gender and secuality as coherent and easily quantifiable categories, this class delves into the nany contradictions in the categories of gender and secuality in order to unpack everyday taken for granted assumptions. Furthermore, students will examine how these categories intersect, how they inform each other, and how they gain raction with race, class, and ethinicity.'),

Course material will bring comparative and historical approaches to examine the relationships between social policies and gender over time, across space, and in the context of different social, economic, cultural, and political systems. We will also draw on critical, feminist, anti-racist, and anti-colonial perspectives to study interactions between policies, gender, race, ethnicity, class, nationality and age, and to imagine transformative actions to bring policy change and to promote gender equality.'),

Governor Cuomo resigned in disgrace, elevating his Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul to the state?s highest post. What difference, if any, has this representation made? The state repealed a ?walking while trans? ban that advocates argued led to discrimination against the LGBTQ community. How did they win this fight, and what has happened since? What are communities and organizers fighting for now? This class will look at these questions and more to understand the roles women and LGBTQ New Yorkers currently hold in our political landscape. It will evaluate how mainstream issues like housing, environmental justice, and labor affect women and queer people, and will dive into the policy issues specific to these communities.'),

The course will take an intersectional approach to all these topics, with a particular focus on intersectionality and Black feminism in week 11. The aim of this course is to think, reflect, and learn about ourselves as socio-historical and cultural beings permeated by linguistic interactions that reinforce and/or resist gender normativity.???.'),

From the 15th century to the contemporary period, we will look at the religious experiences of Africans and Afro-descendants in the Atlantic world (West and West-Central Africa, Europe, and the Americas). We will consider how the historical legacy of racism, slavery, patriarchy, colonialism, and imperialism, as well as Black agency, resistance, and ingenuity, has set the contours for defining and characterizing Black religions across time, space, and geographies. The course offers explorations of distinct traditions such as Orisha-Ifa (Yoruba), Vodun (Fon) or Vodou, Palo (Bakongo), Obeah, Hoodoo, Afro-Catholicism, Afro-Protestantism, Islam, and Espiritismo to inform us of the centrality of Black worship and religiosity in the study of Black Atlantic social, cultural, political, and intellectual history and contemporary life.'),

There is however little effort in pedagogy to place the “other” woman at the center of discussions of empowerment and develop subversive counter narratives that intentionally dis-locate whiteness. I envision this course as an exercise in just this sort of activist feminist inversion; one that centers on critiquing the omniscience of white feminist voices and developing individual narratives that counter them. Divided into four or five components, course discussions will focus on how white womens’ voices dominate discussions of a) war reporting b) travel c) illness d) sexual awakening e) human rights and f) work. The workshop component of this course will focus on developing guerilla counter-narratives in each of these realms with students working on writing their own experiences and developing them for publication. Beyond discussing how structural forces prevent the proliferation of these narratives we will discuss strategies that can be deployed to push more of these stories into the public realm and how this push represents the doing aspect of an active and engaged guerilla feminism. Class discussions will also work on constructing a genealogy for guerilla feminism via the works of other anti-imperialist and radical feminists of color. Guest speakers who have engaged in activism around each of these realms of feminist experience will provide further insight into how these strategies of guerilla feminist counter narratives can be deployed.'),

With attention to how sexual identity intersects with race, class and gender, the course will examine how LGBTQ people can be placed within historical and political contexts. We will question how and why homosexuality became criminalized and the movements that led to decriminalization. We will spend a significant portion of time on the USA and Western Europe in the 19th and 20th century and the development of a contemporary LGBTQ movement. We will also look at how people of various gender identities and sexualities lived before and outside of European colonial context and explore how European colonization influenced changes in perception of people with gender variant identities as well as people outside of heteronormative sexual practices in their local communities.'),

In a disaster’s aftermath long standing social inequalities highlight how the greatest burden of recovery rests disproportionately on poor communities of color.  “Disaster capitalism” is a practice of taking advantage of social and economic instability to centralize policies that under “normal” times communities—what is known as the “State of Exception”--would cause concern.  This course will explore the role of states and societies living through natural and human-made disasters. We will draw on insights from global and local communities that have survived disasters and are resisting historical and economic trauma. We will focus in on the creative activism of colonized, racialized, sexually marginalized and displaced peoples.'),

We will analyze how queer identities are regulated, reinforced, recreated, and subverted through embodied modes of performance. Some of the questions we will discuss are: What is queer performance? Is queer performance a matter of identity or aesthetics? Spatial and temporal influences on our understanding of queer performance? Does queer necessarily mean radical? What are some examples of international queer performance? Does queer performance change based on a culture or is there a shared sense of what it is? What is the connection between queerness and globalization? In countries with high levels of homophobia queerness is often seen as a Western import – how much are artists contributing to cultural colonialism? Does audience affect our understanding of the performance? What is the relationship between class and performance? What is the connection between the gender identity in performance and queerness? We will look at a brief history of LGBTQ performance and its current connection to mass media. We will look at a variety of performances – in mass media, through social networks as well as live performances – theater, drag, burlesque, poetry and more.'),

('WS 31121','Racialization: Single Mothers, Sexual and Religious Minorities','This course offers an introduction to the study of minority and majority group relations in the United States with a comparative focus drawing from examples in Latin America and Europe. We examine the historical factors that have led to the creation of a white majority and a black minority in America and other national contexts; how a minority or majority status is created and internalized by individuals and their youth. We pay close attention to how increasing economic and wealth inequality, globalization and immigration affects the formation of new, minority groups and statuses drawing on the example of growing share of working poor or "missing class" individuals in America; the life chances of the undocumented, and those of single migrant mothers, religious minorities such as Muslim youth and the networks of sexual minorities that help them integrate in society and cope with glaring discrimination and exclusion. Students will be able to engage in informed debates about how increases in family, ethnic, racial and sexual diversity in the US and other nations will help close the historical divides between white and black groups in America. They will also master new knowledge on how race and racialization processes take place in Latin America or in nations such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic where efforts have been made to alleviate racial inequality and tensions, but where blacks and mulattoes have historically make up the majority of the poor and whites and light-skin people still make up the ruling elite.'),

We will interrogate the processes behind producing ethnographic and other nonfiction writing, looking at methods, as well as ethical considerations. Guided by recent decolonial feminist scholarship and queer of color critique, our aim will be to build on a variety of anti-oppressive methodologies such as research-based performed ethnographies, digital storytelling, and other forms.'),
('WS 31129','Queer of Color Critique towards Utopia','In What?s Queer About Queer Studies, editors say that queerness can never be presumed in advance. Queerness is not a cohere term, rather they would say, it is always in flux, reinventing itself as a process and identity. In this course, we will examine this assertion and ask, who is queer? Why are they queer? When are they queer? Beginning with Cathy Cohen and Roderick Furgeson we will learn the connections between the process of racialization and queerness.  We will then move to theorists such as Jasbir Puar who examines the relationship between the Racial State and queerness. Finally, we will interrogate the relationship queer studies, and queer of color critique has with antiblackness and settler colonialism. We will end this course drawing on Jose Munoz?s theories on utopia in order to discuss the future of queer theory and its usefulness in the project of abolition, and in reimagining the world as we know it.

We will pay close attention to persistent conflicts over issues like revolution vs. reform; coalition vs. single-issue politics; difference vs. assimilation; and grassroots vs. professional organizations. Finally, we will look at the connection between LGBTQ+ movements and other movements on the left and right. In particular, we will trace the LGBTQ+ movement''s relationship with movements for racial, gender, and economic justice as well as the ways LGBTQ+ activism shaped ? and was shaped by ? anti-gay and anti-feminist movements. We will end by thinking about the future of LGBTQ+ movements in our current moment of backlash.'),

('WS 31164','Being Queer, Being Trans','Both trans and queer are expansive terms that carry connotations beyond just gender or sexual identity. This course examines some of the various ways being trans or being queer have been rendered historically and socially, from the records of medical institutions and colonial accounts of non-European gender and sexuality, to historical and contemporary accounts produced by trans people themselves. This course covers a range of queer and trans perspectives to uncover what they can tell us about the organization of sex, gender, race, class, and other forms of social difference.'),

('WS 31191','Autoethnography: Cultural Analysis, Social Change, and Introspection','How can researchers understand cultural change in society alongside their own experience in it? In this course, students will gain an understanding of autoethnography, anthropological research, writing, and storytelling that connects the autobiographical and personal to the cultural, social, and political (Ellis, 2004: xix). Students will learn how to develop their own authentic ethnographic perspectives while exploring the implications of societal change on them - finding their own voices through better understanding of the intersections between participant-observation and self-observation.

('WS 31210','Order in the Courtroom: Law and Narrative Power','Whose story is Adjudicator Collins telling here? Would Samuel Jonathan Ramirez Perez, the detainee, tell the story different? How about the passengers? The pilot? If this were enacted as play or film, who would play the part of Canada? "Narrative is radical," said Toni Morrison when accepting her Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, "creating us at the very moment it is being created." Three years later, James Baldwin wrote: “The law is meant to be my servant and not my master, still less my torturer and my murderer.” Courtrooms are often portrayed as uniquely powerful places for disenfranchised individuals and peoples to “tell their story.” In this course, we will consider how law, legal venues, and legal workers are represented in literary and cultural texts. We will also examine how we can read critical and literary theory into legal analysis. This course aims to further a social justice politic by helping us think through the law, to see both the stories it tells and the stories it hides.'),
('WS 31220','Gender and Women in the Middle East','This course examines the history of women and gender from the rise of Islam to the spread of contemporary Islamic political movements.

('WS 31256','Masculinity and Latinidad: Redefining Masculinities in the U.S.','The concept of hegemonic masculinity has been used to explain societal behaviors in terms of men''s power over women. In this course, we will analyze the connection to the marginalization of Latinx communities in mainstream U.S. culture, and the way stereotypical cultural attitudes are too easily attributed to machismo and stagnant characterizations of Latinx men, i.e., behaviors that conform to racist expectations of men of color. We will also explore how Latinx men break with tradition in the arts, literature, and popular culture.'),

('WS 31375','From the Cakewalk to the Catwalk: A Survey of New York’s Black and Latino LGBTQ Ball/House Culture','Ball/House Culture or “Ballroom” is a Black and Latino LGBTQ subculture rooted in New York City that is a celebration of fashion, language, music and dance. Ballroom has enjoyed many mainstream moments, most notably in the late 1980s with music videos like Madonna’s “Vogue” as well as the 1989 documentary film, Paris is Burning. Today, many are familiar with the culture through shows like Pose and My House. Ballroom culture has an extensive history with multiple genesis points that include drag ball culture during The Harlem Renaissance, 19th century charity balls in New York City as well as Antebellum Slavery plantation practices, West African dance traditions and Medieval European court systems. To understand the complexity of this culture and its relationship to a uniquely “Black Atlantic” experience, this course will examine Ballroom Culture by homing in on its unique aesthetics, language, musical production, customs related to kinship and family, as well as its most well-known dance form, “voguing.”'),
('WS 31401','From the Harem to the Midan: (Counter-)Spaces of Gender and Sexuality in the Arab Region','From the Harem to the Midan: (Counter-)Spaces of Gender and Sexuality in the Arab Region This course applies a spatial lens to the study of gender and sexuality in the Arab region. Drawing upon feminist and queer theory, feminist geography, and critical urban studies, we will focus on a number of spaces to examine how, through their inhabitation, people throughout North Africa, the Middle East, and the Gulf conform to, reproduce, resist, and subvert dominant norms about gender and sexuality. The harem, the hammam (the public bathhouse), the café, the public garden, the shopping mall, the gym, the midan (the public square), the prison, and the Internet are some of the spaces through which we will explore the production of (counter-)spaces for self-expression, leisure, romance, (homo-)erotic desire, sociability, and politics. The course adopts an intersectional approach to analyze how gender inflects upon and is inflected by race, class, sexuality, religion/sect, and nationality in the production of space from a multi-scalar perspective that considers the home in relation to the neighborhood, the city, and the state. We will engage memoirs, fiction, historical texts, academic articles, art, films, and other media to complicate notions of public and private, consider questions of embodiment and agency, and discuss the transformation of these spaces and of people’s inhabitation of them over time and across borders.'),

Throughout most of the world, for much of human history, the goddess reigned supreme. Even the early Israelites--the original monotheists--worshipped the divine feminine for centuries. In this course, we will explore the saga of the goddess, from her ancient roots to her demise at the hands of the biblical prophets and scribes.

To examine how such social constructions of sexualities and gender intersect with race, ethnicity, class, ability, and other social identity categories, we examine macro level issues of colonialism, imperialism, immigration and migration, mass incarceration and policing as they pertain to racial and sexual/gender minorities. We will also cover immediate and ongoing issues, such as transphobia, drag queen phobia, activism/social movements, media representation, homelessness, and book banning that impact the everyday experiences of LGBTQ+ people, especially queer youth.'),
